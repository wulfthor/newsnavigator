Also, we don't know what the impact may be in terms of cooperation to address the Syria crisis.\"</p><p></p><p>The humanitarian community was clinging to the hope that the Kremlin might not opt for a more aggressive stance towards the Syrian crisis, she said, and that they had not detected a different approach since the Ukranian crisis ignited last month.</p><p></p><p>\"On a technical level, we have not seen any change – but when you are in a cold climate it is more difficult to get people to reach the right decision, and we need the international community to be very firmly united,\" Georgieva said. The EU commission is responsible for more than 40% of the EU's humanitarian aid – <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/mar/19/eu-funding-gap-threatens-vital-humanitarian-aid-projects\" title=\"\">itself under budgetary pressure</a> – which provides almost a third of global humanitarian aid.</p><p></p><p>Moscow, keen to assert its diplomatic and economic influence in the Middle East, has been a major provider of conventional weaponry to Syria while obstructing western attempts to penalise Assad with sanctions for the use of force against civilians.</p><p></p><p>Georgieva said: \"The humanitarian community is worried about the diversion of attention and the shadow that may be thrown in terms of international relations and its capacity to handle complex situations, Syria being at the top of my mind because of the enormity of the crisis.\"</p><p></p><p>Russia has protected its ally Syria on the UN security council during the civil war, and has vetoed three resolutions condemning Syria's government and threatening it with possible sanctions. However, Russia backed last month's <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-26311212\" title=\"\">security council resolution on improving access to aid convoys</a> in Syria.</p><p></p><p>\"It is critical to get more help inside Syria, we have to make the UN security council resolution on access work; we have made some progress, this is critical to prevent an even more massive wave of refugees,\" Georgieva said.</p><p></p><p>The security council is expecting its first report from the secretary general on whether the Syrian government and the rebels have complied with the UN's resolution to improve access for aid workers. More certain is that the numbers of Syrians needing help will continue to rise, with families increasingly unable to afford to feed themselves, prompting further displacement. \"Food is excruciatingly expensive. In one place we have reports of a 70-times increase in prices,\" Georgieva said.</p><p></p><p>There are signs that the Ukranian crisis is exerting a negative impact on the international community's response to humanitarian trouble spots. Diplomatic sources recently warned that the annexation of Crimea had hampered EU plans to send troops to the Central African Republic (CAR) because anxious eastern European countries were keen to retain their troops rather than send them to the African country, where experts describe a \"slow-motion genocide\" unfolding.</p><p></p><p>Georgieva was speaking at the launch of the <a href=\"https://internationalmedicalcorps.org/campaigns/first-responders\" title=\"\">\"first responders\" campaign</a>, which is backed by the International Medical Corps and recognises the role of local people and organisations in coping with the initial, often most critical, phase of humanitarian disasters.</p><p></p><p>She said the aid community must learn to deal with more than one urgent situation at a time, pointing out that the crisis in the CAR and South Sudan were deepening alongside the crisis in Syria.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/432659064|2014-05-04T12:09:16Z|c4c7fd5823e457942777799d19b8a42d5d343378 -->",

	"body" : "<p>The former Republican congressman and three-time presidential candidate Ron Paul has launched a scathing attack on what he calls a US-backed coup in Ukraine, insisting <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/13/crimea-referendum-explainer-ukraine-russia\">the Crimean people</a> have the right to align their territory with Moscow and characterising <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/10/western-officials-london-finalise-sanctions-russia\">sanctions against Russia</a> as “an act of war”.</p><p>He also said providing economic aid to Ukraine was comparable to giving support to rebels in Syria knowing it would end up in the hands of al-Qaida.<br /></p><p>The libertarian guru’s remarks in an interview with the Guardian are almost diametrically opposed to those of his son, the Republican presidential hopeful Rand Paul, who has called for stiff penalties against Russia and declared: “If I were president, I wouldn’t let [Russian president] Vladimir Putin get away with it.”</p><p>Ron Paul, who retired from his Texas congressional seat in 2012, has always adopted a sceptical view of US foreign interventions. He said that although the US had not been involved in any military overthrow of the government in Kiev, it had facilitated a coup in the sense of “agitating” elements who wanted to usurp Ukraine’s former president, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/viktor-yanukovych\">Victor Yanukovych</a>.</p><p>“The evidence is pretty clear that the NGOs [non-governmental organisations] financed by our government have been agitating with billions of dollars, trying to get that government changed,” he said. “Our hands are not clean.”</p><p>There is broad bipartisan support on Capitol Hill for the movement that brought about the departure of Yanukovych, as well as criticism of Putin for Russia’s military intervention in Crimea, which many view as a prelude to annexing the territory.</p><p>A Russian-backed referendum, in which Crimeans will be asked if they want to align their government with Moscow, will take place on Sunday, although western leaders argue the poll has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/mar/14/crimean-referendum-illegal-international-law\">no legitimacy or legal basis</a>.</p><p>Paul said Crimeans should be allowed to break away from Kiev. </p><p>“I think everyone should have right to express themselves,” he said. “It is messy, that is for sure, because two big governments are very much involved in trying to tell the Ukranians what to do.”</p><p>However he said Russia had a more justifiable basis for being involved in Crimea than the US, and no government should prevent locals on the peninsula from determining their future.</p><p>“That is our how our country was started,” he said. “It was the right of self-determination, and voting, and asking and even fighting for it, and seceding. Of course libertarians were delighted with the secession of the various countries and units of government away from the Soviet Union, so yes, we want the people to make the decisions.”</p><p>He added: “The people of Ukraine would probably have a loose-knit association, with a rather independent east and west, and an independent Crimea. It would work quite well.”</p><p>Paul, who now runs his own <a href=\"http://www.ronpaulchannel.com/\">internet TV channel</a>, also took issue with a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/12/us-aid-ukraine-limbo-congress-imf-reforms\">$1bn aid package</a> for Ukraine which is going through Congress. </p><p>“Now we’re getting involved with the Europeans in trying to change the government of Ukraine,” he said. “Now they want our money. It is just like when we when we go out and try and throw out [Syrian president Bashar al-] Assad, we end up working with al-Qaida. Now we’re likely to give money to Ukraine so they can pay their bills to Russia. That is the insanity of it all.”</p><p>His son, an increasingly <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/09/rand-paul-definitely-considering-republican-2016-presidential-run\">strong contender</a> for the Republican presidential nomination, made a similar point in the Senate on Thursday, when he voted against a bill providing aid to Ukraine. </p><p>The Kentucky senator is far more pragmatic than his father, however, and is on a mission to recast his reputation as a mainstream potential commander-in-chief. This week, he used an <a href=\"http://time.com/17648/sen-rand-paul-u-s-must-take-strong-action-against-putins-aggression/\">op-ed piece in Time magazine</a> to exhibit his foreign policy credentials, adopting a tough stance against Moscow.</p><p>“Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine is a gross violation of that nation’s sovereignty and an affront to the international community,” he wrote. “His continuing occupation of Ukraine is completely unacceptable, and Russia’s president should be isolated for his actions.”</p><p>He added: “Economic sanctions and visa bans should be imposed and enforced without delay.”</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-b99f3436-2c17-4dbe-b5bf-c2e7a7c52155\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/14/1394830958658/54b785fd-a225-4539-9e07-9417d228311e-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Ron Paul, Rand Paul\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Ron Paul with his son Rand, at a 2011 presidential campaign event.

They’re acts of war,” he told the Guardian.</p><p>“It is based on a moral principle of theft. They want to target sanctions against 20 or 30 bad Russians who they claim have committed a crime against humanity, and therefore we’re going to freeze their assets and steal them from them.”</p><p>When it was suggested his position was opposite to that of his son, Paul replied: “Neither he nor I have ever pretended our views are identical. He still has the most libertarian views in the Senate.”</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/432129543|2014-05-04T12:09:16Z|33f88d806b5163f1d5a7de1db37dd55809f2c6c3 -->",

	"body" : "<p>If anyone had hoped that the Arab Spring and Occupy protests a few years back were one-off episodes that would soon give way to more stability, they have another thing coming. The hope was that ongoing economic recovery would return to pre-crash levels of growth, alleviating the grievances fueling the fires of civil unrest, stoked by years of recession. </p><p>But this hasn't happened. And <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/earth-insight/2013/jul/19/economy-end-growth-resource-scarcity-costs\">it won't</a>.</p><p>Instead the post-2008 crash era, including 2013 and early 2014, has seen a persistence and proliferation of civil unrest on a scale that has never been seen before in human history. This month alone has seen riots kick-off in <a href=\"http://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/top-stories/venezuela-third-night-of-riots-over-dead-students-1-3307673\">Venezuela</a>, <a href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2014/02/who-behind-bosnia-riots-201429132930915905.html\">Bosnia</a>, <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2014/02/26/world/europe/ukraine-politics/\">Ukraine</a>, <a href=\"http://guardianlv.com/2014/02/iceland-protests-started-as-global-epidemic-of-riots-continues/\">Iceland</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/17/thailand-protesters-besiege-temporary-government-hq\">Thailand</a>.  </p><p>This is not a coincidence. The riots are of course rooted in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/27/recipe-revolution-ukraine-thailand-venezuela-turkey\">common, regressive economic forces</a> playing out across every continent of the planet - but those forces themselves are symptomatic of a deeper, protracted process of global system failure as we transition from the old industrial era of dirty fossil fuels, towards something else.</p><p>Even before the Arab Spring erupted in Tunisia in December 2010, analysts at the New England Complex Systems Institute warned of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2013/mar/06/food-riots-new-normal\">danger of civil unrest</a> due to escalating food prices. If the Food &amp; Agricultural Organisation (FAO) food price index rises above 210, they warned, it could trigger riots across large areas of the world. </p><h2>Hunger games</h2><p>The pattern is clear. Food price spikes in 2008 coincided with the eruption of social unrest in Tunisia, Egypt, Yemen, Somalia, Cameroon, Mozambique, Sudan, Haiti, and India, among others. </p><p>In 2011, the price spikes preceded social unrest across the Middle East and North Africa - Egypt, Syria, Iraq, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Libya, Uganda, Mauritania, Algeria, and so on. </p><p>Last year saw food prices reach <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/212018/icode/\">their third highest year on record</a>, corresponding to the latest outbreaks of street violence and protests in Argentina, Brazil, Bangladesh, China, Kyrgyzstan, Turkey and elsewhere.</p><p>Since about a decade ago, the FAO food price index has more than doubled from 91.1 in 2000 to an average of 209.8 in 2013. As Prof Yaneer Bar-Yam, founding president of the Complex Systems Institute, told <a href=\"http://motherboard.vice.com/blog/a-complex-systems-model-predicted-the-revolutions-sweeping-the-globe-right\">Vice magazine</a> last week: </p><blockquote><p>\"Our analysis says that 210 on the FAO index is the boiling point and we have been hovering there for the past 18 months... In some of the cases the link is more explicit, in others, given that we are at the boiling point, anything will trigger unrest.\"</p></blockquote><p>But Bar-Yam's analysis of the causes of the global food crisis don't go deep enough - he focuses on the impact of farmland being used for biofuels, and excessive financial speculation on food commodities. But these factors barely scratch the surface.</p><h2>It's a gas</h2><p>The recent cases illustrate not just an explicit link between civil unrest and an increasingly volatile global food system, but also the root of this problem in the increasing unsustainability of our chronic civilisational addiction to fossil fuels. </p><p>In Ukraine, previous food price shocks have impacted negatively on the country's grain exports, contributing to intensifying <a href=\"http://www.case-research.eu/upload/publikacja_plik/30758916_CNSA_403 final version.pdf\">urban poverty</a> in particular. Accelerating levels of domestic inflation are underestimated in <a href=\"http://www.kyivpost.com/content/business/inflation-in-ukraine-in-december-accelerates-to-05-percent-334741.html\">official statistics</a> - Ukrainians spend on average as much as 75% on household bills, and <a href=\"http://ukrainianweek.com/Economics/62435\">more than half their incomes</a> on necessities such as food and non-alcoholic drinks, and as75% on household bills. Similarly, for most of last year, Venezuela suffered from ongoing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2013/sep/26/venezuela-food-shortages-rich-country-cia\">food shortages</a> driven by policy mismanagement along with 17 year record-high inflation due mostly to rising food prices. </p><p>While dependence on increasingly expensive food imports plays a role here, at the heart of both countries is a deepening energy crisis. Ukraine is a net energy importer, having <a href=\"http://blogg.nhh.no/reconhub/?p=2059\">peaked</a> in oil and gas production way back in 1976. Despite excitement about domestic shale potential, Ukraine's oil production has declined by over 60% over the last twenty years driven by both geological challenges and dearth of investment. </p><p>Currently, about 80% of Ukraine's oil, and 80% of its gas, is imported from Russia. But over half of Ukraine's energy consumption is sustained by gas. Russian natural gas prices have nearly quadrupled since 2004. The rocketing energy prices underpin the inflation that is driving excruciating poverty rates for average Ukranians, exacerbating social, ethnic, political and class divisions. </p><p>The Ukrainian government's recent decision to <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/02/25/us-ukraine-gazprom-idUSBREA1O0KT20140225\">dramatically slash Russian gas imports</a> will likely worsen this as alternative cheaper energy sources are in short supply. Hopes that domestic energy sources might save the day are slim - apart from the fact that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/earth-insight/2013/jun/21/shale-gas-peak-oil-economic-crisis\">shale cannot solve the prospect of expensive liquid fuels</a>, nuclear will not help either. A leaked <a href=\"http://www.euractiv.com/europes-east/power-prices-ukraine-expected-do-news-532902\">European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) report</a> reveals that proposals to loan 300 million Euros to renovate Ukraine's ageing infrastructure of 15 state-owned nuclear reactors will gradually double already debilitating electricity prices by 2020. </p><h2>\"Socialism\" or Soc-oil-ism?</h2><p>In Venezuela, the story is familiar. Previously, the Oil and Gas Journal reported the country's oil reserves were 99.4 billion barrels. As of 2011, this was revised upwards to a mammoth 211 billion barrels of proven oil reserves, and more recently by the US Geological Survey to a whopping 513 billion barrels. The massive boost came from the discovery of reserves of extra heavy oil in the Orinoco belt. </p><p>The huge associated costs of production and refining this heavy oil compared to cheaper conventional oil, however, mean the new finds have contributed little to Venezuela's escalating energy and economic challenges. Venezuela's oil production <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/09/world/americas/venezuelas-role-as-oil-power-diminished.html?_r=0\">peaked</a> around 1999, and has declined by a quarter since then. Its gas production peaked around 2001, and has declined by about a third. </p><p>Simultaneously, as domestic oil consumption has steadily increased - in fact almost doubling since 1990 - this has eaten further into declining production, resulting in net oil exports <a href=\"http://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Desperate-to-Boost-Oil-Production-Venezuela-Moves-to-Devalue-Currency.html\">plummeting</a> by nearly half since 1996. As oil represents 95% of export earnings and about <a href=\"https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ve.html\">half of budget revenues</a>, this decline has massively reduced the scope to sustain government social programmes, including critical subsidies. </p><h2>Looming pandemic?</h2><p>These local conditions are being exacerbated by global structural realities. Record high global food prices impinge on these local conditions and push them over the edge. But the food price hikes, in turn, are symptomatic of a range of overlapping problems. Global agriculture's excessive dependence on fossil fuel inputs means food prices are invariably linked to oil price spikes. Naturally, biofuels and food commodity speculation pushes prices up even further - elite financiers alone benefit from this while working people from middle to lower classes bear the brunt. </p><p>Of course, the elephant in the room is <a href=\"http://www.euractiv.com/cap/climate-change-food-security-wor-analysis-533530\">climate change</a>. According to Japanese media, a <a href=\"http://zeenews.india.com/news/eco-news/un-report-sees-usd-1-45-tn-global-warming-cost-media_914918.html\">leaked draft</a> of the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) second major report warned that while demand for food will rise by 14%, global crop production will drop by 2% per decade due to current levels of global warming, and wreak $1.45 trillion of economic damage by the end of the century. The scenario is based on a projected rise of 2.5 degrees Celsius. </p><p>This is likely to be a very <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/earth-insight/2013/sep/18/climate-change-double-impact-study\">conservative estimate</a>. Considering that the current trajectory of industrial agriculture is already seeing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/earth-insight/2013/dec/19/industrial-agriculture-limits-peak-food\">yield plateaus</a> in major food basket regions, the interaction of environmental, energy, and economic crises suggests that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/earth-insight/2013/jun/07/peak-soil-industrial-civilisation-eating-itself\">business-as-usual won't work</a>. </p><p>The epidemic of global riots is symptomatic of global system failure - a civilisational form that has outlasted its usefulness.

They might open Joy to the World with a softly conventional reading of Irving Berlin's White Christmas, but that dissolves into a swooning version of the song in Japanese, which is followed by carols in Russian and Hebrew, Arabic interventions into Silent Night and Auld Lang Syne, and a take on We Three Kings dense with African drums. This bid to make a \"holiday album for everyone\" might sound dreadfully self-righteous, were it not for three things: Pink Martini's ability to leaven sincerity with kitschness; the sumptuous musicianship, particularly in the shimmering Ukranian bell carol Shchedryk; and China Forbes's elegant, crisp voice. She brings a wonderful frostiness to Little Drummer Boy, and makes Do You Hear What I Hear?, composed during the Cuban Missile Crisis, sounds as impassioned as an address to the UN.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/369252606|2014-05-04T12:09:17Z|bdbcead1eb40759d6ca7f18cfe2b34f9ab21f0c3 -->",

Here’s a flavour:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>It was designed as a relaxed televised chat with a small group of invited journalists by a relaxed leader in full command of the situation. But it became a rambling, often tetchy performance from Putin, repeatedly scolding journalists for failing to understand him, or for leaving their mobile phones on.</p><p>But amid the irritability and hectoring, there were some clear messages. First of all, Russian feels bound by no international legal constraints on its actions in Ukraine, least of all the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, by which Russia and western states pledged to respect Ukrainian territorial integrity in return for Kiev’s surrender of its Soviet-era nuclear arsenal. Putin dispensed with that particular piece of paper in a couple of lines.</p><p>“If it’s a revolution, what does that mean? It’s hard not to agree that a new government is appearing in this country, just like in Russia after 1917,” Putin said. “We didn’t sign any documents with this government.”</p></blockquote><h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/04/putin-ukraine-olive-branches-russian-tanks\">Putin offers Ukraine olive branches delivered by Russian tanks</a></h2> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-53160566e4b093d4729c31fa\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-03-04T16:55:08.523Z\">4.55pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/TradeDesk_Steve/statuses/440890354750201856\"> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Escalation from Kerry here : -

Hague claims that the government has not ruled out trade sanctions against Russia <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/03/uk-seeks-russia-harm-city-london-document\">(as the secret document photographed outside Downing Street implied). </a></b>The document does not represent government policy, he said. (See<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2014/mar/04/william-hagues-statement-to-mps-on-ukraine-politics-live-blog#block-5315c06ee4b0da1677ed2d0a\"> 12.15pm.) </a>But nothing he said suggests that full-blown trade sanctions are on the agenda.</p><p><b>2. Britain is determined to act in collaboration with the EU. </b>In response to repeated questions about what was and was not being considered, Hague essentially said that we would all just have to wait until EU leaders meet on Thursday. The Conservatives used to be wary of the EU having its own foreign policy, but this afternoon Hague did not seem to countenance Britain acting outwith the EU, and he barely mentioned the US at all. He sounded as communautaire as a Luxembourgian.</p><p><b>3. Tory anti-Russian grandstanding is out. </b><a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/georgia/2569377/Georgia-David-Cameron-flies-into-Tbilisi-to-meet-countrys-leaders.html\">Remember when David Cameron was opposition leader, and he flew to Tblisi to express solidarity with Georgia after it was invaded by Russia in 2008? </a>“I think it’s important that the world’s oldest democracy must stand with one of the newest when it’s been illegally invaded by another country,” Cameron said then. Now the tone is very different. Hague repeatedly condemned Russia, but he did so in a measured and relatively restrained way. </p><p><b>4. Partisan divisions do not apply over Ukraine.</b> Douglas Alexander made a spirited attempt to criticise the government’s approach, but what was striking was the absence of any clear Labour/Conservative division as backbenchers commented on the crisis. There was a hawks/doves division (with the hawks pushing for more robust economic sanctions), but the MPs were not split along party lines.</p><p><b>5. Younger MPs seem more likely to be “hawkish” than older ones.</b> At least, that was the impression I got.

Asked what this meant, he explained:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>That means it starts with the measures that we’ve seen in terms of the withdrawal of participation in the preparatory meetings for the June G8 meeting, the further steps that have been announced by the American overnight in relation to military cooperation. But it should include other diplomatic measures – and indeed other economic measures – not being taken off the table at this time.</p></blockquote><p><b>• He said that letting a photographer see <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/03/uk-seeks-russia-harm-city-london-document\">a secret note setting out the government’s strategy was a serious mistake.</a></b></p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>We’ve seen reports overnight of what was a serious blunder at a serious time by the government, revealing what seemed to be a discord between what was being recommended to ministers in private and what was being said in public.</p></blockquote><p><b>• He said Ukraine should respect the rights of the Russian minority in the country. </b>He said the West should insist on this as part of a twin-track strategy.</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>I think the right approach is a twin-track strategy. On the one hand, a graduated hierarchy of diplomatic and economic measures to make clear there are costs and consequences for the Russian Federation; but on the other hand being very clear that we want to see an inclusive government in Kiev, we want to see protection for the rights of the Russian minorities within the Ukraine and that the potential European Union trade association should not preclude effective and continuing trade relations between Ukraine and Russia.</p></blockquote><p><b>• He said it was not in Russia’s interests to be isolated.</b></p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>The Russian president spent billions of roubles on the Sochi Olympics to try and accumulate soft power in the world.

Russia and Georgia fought a brief war in August 2008 over the disputed territory of South Ossetia, which has many similarities with recent developments in Ukraine. The key point is that the conflict was short-lived and ended by an EU-sponsored ceasefire. Russian forces still occupy South Ossetia which has now declared independence from Georgia, a position that very few other countries officially recognise but no-one can realistically do anything about. A similar outcome in Crimea would soon drop out of the daily headlines (as have the ongoing tragedies in Syria and South Sudan).</p><p>Second, though, Ukraine is roughly ten times larger than Georgia in terms of population (45 million vs. 5 million) and GDP ($180bn vs. $16bn). Ukraine’s financial markets and external debts are correspondingly much greater and it is a more credible candidate for EU membership in due course. Indeed, unlike Georgia, Ukraine shares borders with four current EU members. Third, regional turmoil could also have a major impact on the Russian economy itself and on its trade, particularly in energy, with the rest of the world. The country’s financial markets and currency have already been hit hard, prompting an emergency rate hike Monday morning in an attempt to stem capital outflows.</p><p>Two specific risks are worth dwelling on. One is the possibility of the disruption to the supply of Russian energy to the European Union, whether as a result of Western sanctions or Russian manipulation. Russia is of course a major supplier of oil to Germany and the Netherlands in particular and of natural gas to Western Europe generally. However, disruption to energy trade would be in neither side’s interest, especially Russia’s as it would simply encourage EU customers to seek more secure supplies elsewhere. We suspect that any Western sanctions will only target individuals and political and cultural links, rather than trade.</p><p>The other issue is the financial burden of supporting Ukraine. The country needs around $25bn soon to refinance debt and pay other bills for goods and services. Over the longer-term, the cost of supporting the transition could run into the hundreds of billions of dollars. These are not particularly large sums when measured against the combined resources of the IMF and the major advanced economies who might be willing to offer bilateral support. Nonetheless, every dollar spent on Ukraine is a dollar not available to finance bailouts elsewhere, including the weaker economies of the euro-zone. &lt;end&gt;</p> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-03-03T17:35:30.688Z\">at 5.35pm GMT</time></p> </div> <div id=\"block-5314b581e4b093d4729c3120\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-03-03T17:07:09.317Z\">5.07pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p><b>Update - the German DAX has now officially closed, and it’s an even deeper fall than initially thought.</b></p><p>Germany’s index of leading shares tumbled 333.19 points to 9,358, a drop of 3.44%.</p><p>That’s very slightly worse than the 3.41% tumble on 1 June 2012.

The potential of the situation to deepen and intensify remains large.</strong></h2><p>Russia has been known to be unpredictable in the past and its aggressive and quick action in the region, along with parliamentary backing for further troop deployment not just in Crimea but the Ukraine as well, shows that it remains steadfast to increase its presence in the region. Russia has historically shown that it will protect its assets and people without hesitation. This is exactly what it is doing.</p><p></p><h2><strong>2. The reaction of the G7 is crucial.</strong></h2><p>Do they call Russia’s bluff? Even if Ukraine strikes at Russian troops in the Crimea region, it will still be the response of the G7 that holds the key for complete market volatility and fear. It’s hard to see at this stage, with Russia holding all the cards, for the west to dramatically do anything other than appease Russian aggression.<br /></p><p></p><p></p><h2><strong>3. A quick look at oil prices shows the impact this situation could have.</strong></h2><p>Nymex front month oil futures prices hit their highest level since September last year, hitting $104 a barrel. Further oil price rises will have a knock-on effect on stocks and sectors that rely on a stable oil price to keep fundamental costs down. Rising oil prices is a direct threat to the ability of stocks to rally in the near term. This needs to be watched.<br /></p><p></p><h2><strong>4. Key indices have also hit major resistance levels</strong></h2><p>The crisis could give investors the excuse they need for a 5%-10% market correction. </p><p>Market corrections are healthy for the long term bullishness of major indices and as such, should not be feared. However, with the FTSE 100, DAX and Dow Jones all recently hitting levels which triggered selling, a small price correction could now be due. So if anything, the timing of the Ukraine crisis may have well triggered the inevitable.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-531478f2e4b093d4729c30e1\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-03-03T12:45:06.083Z\">12.45pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p><b>Stephanie Flanders, </b>JP Morgan’s chief market strategist for UK and Europe (<i>and former BBC economics editor</i>) suggests today’s heavy selloff in Russian stocks has created some real bargains for investors:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>“Events in Ukraine have clearly pushed investors into “risk-off” mode, especially when it comes to emerging market assets. Aside from this short-term volatility, we would still say the direct economic and financial fallout from Ukraine itself was fairly limited - though markets are perhaps not focused enough on the broader contagion that could follow a messy Ukrainian sovereign default.</p><p>However, Russia’s involvement clearly magnifies the scope for contagion and increases the possibility that global energy prices will be affected both directly and indirectly, because of Russia’s previous negotiating role in the Middle East.</p><p>We have been saying for some time that emerging market assets look cheap, and Russia’s looked cheaper than most.

Yet it is far from clear that west European members want to take ownership of rescuing the sprawling former Soviet republic of 46 million people. <br /></p><p>The European Commission’s economics chief, Olli Rehn, promised substantial financial support on Sunday and went out on a political limb by saying the country should be given the prospect of joining the EU one day. “From a European point of view it is important that we provide a clear European perspective for the Ukrainian people who have shown their commitment to European values,” Rehn said after a meeting of the world’s financial leaders in Sydney.</p><p>“European perspective” is EU-speak for a membership prospect. Not all of the 28 member states support that view. </p><p>Rehn made clear that Brussels stood ready to provide more than the 610 million euros ($838 million) in immediate assistance that was on offer last November when Yanukovich spurned a far-reaching economic pact with the EU, preferring Vladimir Putin’s promise of a $15 billion bailout from Russia. </p><p>EU officials have said that by front-loading amounts planned over a seven-year period under the proposed association agreement, Kiev could receive more than 2 billion euros quickly once a deal was signed. </p><p>The EU could also bring forward access to its own market of 500 million consumers before full ratification, but Ukraine doesn’t have much to sell.</p><p>All that would require a Ukrainian government empowered to sign the deal, which would probably have to wait until after a presidential election now set for May 25. <br /></p><p>Some experts such as Michael Leigh, a former top civil servant in the European Commission’s enlargement department, say the agreement was flawed and should be rewritten to offer more incentives and pose fewer demands in terms of Ukraine adopting swathes of EU legislation and standards. <br /></p><p>Economists say implementing the proposed Deep and Comprehensive Trade Area could further weaken the Ukrainian economy initially, hitting uncompetitive industries that have sold most of their output to Russia.</p><p>There are also big political risks, with the release of jailed opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko raising the prospect of bitter rivalry for power in Kiev. EU officials recall her period as prime minister after Ukraine’s 2004/5 pro-democracy Orange Revolution as hardly less corrupt than Yanukovich’s tenure. Ukraine is 144th on watchdog Transparency International’s index of perceived corruption.</p><p>“Political uncertainty has arguably increased - including around the outcome of the presidential election set for 25 May - bringing with it a potential increase in the probability of a sovereign default,” Nomura political analyst Alastair Newton said. </p><p>Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, whose country played a central role in the negotiations, highlighted the stakes for the EU in a country that borders his own.</p><p>“We are dealing in Ukraine with the first sacrifices of life for the integration of Europe. Today it is tragic, but in the future this will be a true hope for Ukraine,” he said on Friday. </p><p>Yet much of western Europe is suffering enlargement fatigue after the bloc admitted 13 new mostly ex-communist central and east European members since 2004.</p><p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">EU co-founder France, in particular, would rather keep Ukraine and Turkey, which has been negotiating for accession in slow motion since 2005, in an outer ring of partners outside the bloc.

The president’s spokesman said Sunday morning that even he does not know where Yanukovych is.<br /></p><p>The Kiev protest camp at the center of the anti-Yanukovych movement was calm but still full of dedicated demonstrators Sunday morning, after a day that saw a stunning reversal of fortune in a political standoff that has worried the United States, Europe and Russia.<br /></p><p>Ukraine is deeply divided between eastern regions that are largely pro-Russian and western areas that widely detest Yanukovych and long for closer ties with the European Union. Yanukovych’s shelving of an agreement with the EU in November set off the wave of protests, but they quickly expanded their grievances to corruption, human rights abuses and calls for Yanukovych’s resignation.<br /></p><p>The political crisis in the nation of 46 million has changed with blinding speed repeatedly in the past week. First there were signs that tensions were easing, followed by horrifying violence and then a deal signed under Western pressure that aimed to resolve the conflict but left the unity of the country in question.<br />Protester self-defense units who have taken control of the capital peacefully changed shifts Sunday. <br /></p><p>Helmeted and wearing makeshift shields, they have replaced police guarding the president’s administration and parliament, and have sought to stop radical forces from inflicting damage or unleashing violence.<br /></p><p>Thousands of curious and contemptuous Ukrainians roamed the suddenly open grounds of the lavish compound outside Kiev where Yanukovych was believed to live.<br /></p><p>Parliament, which he controlled the previous day but is now emboldened against him, voted to remove him and set elections for May 25. But Yanukovych said in a televised address that he now regards the parliament as illegitimate and he won’t respect its decisions.<br /></p><p>Tymoshenko, whose diadem of blond peasant braids and stirring rhetoric attracted world attention in the 2004 Orange Revolution was both sad and excited as she spoke to a crowd of about 50,000 on Kiev’s Independence Square, where a sprawling protest tent camp was set up in December. Sitting in a wheelchair because of a back problem aggravated during imprisonment, her voice cracked and her face was careworn.<br /></p><p>But her words were vivid, praising the protesters who were killed this week in clashes with police that included sniper fire and entreating the living to keep the camp going.<br /></p><p>“You are heroes, you are the best thing in Ukraine!” she said of the victims. The Health Ministry said the death toll in clashes between protesters and police that included sniper attacks had reached 82 dead over the last week. The protesters put that figure at over 100.<br /></p><p>And she urged the demonstrators not to yield their encampment in the square, known in Ukrainian as the Maidan.<br /></p>“In no case do you have the right to leave the Maidan until you have concluded everything that you planned to do,” she said.<br /><br /></blockquote> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-02-23T10:38:22.274Z\">at 10.38am GMT</time></p> </div> <div id=\"block-5309b28fe4b06aebce0d0064\" class=\"block is-summary\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-02-23T08:45:53.394Z\">8.45am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Summary</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>After a series of dramatic developments on Saturday, here is where Ukraine stands on Sunday.</p><p>• <b>Ukraine’s parliament voted to impeach the president, Viktor Yanukovych, and strip him of his powers after three months of street protests</b>.

Here’s a summary of where things stand:</p><p><b>• Diplomatic efforts continued into the night to resolve a three-day standoff</b> between forces loyal to Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych and anti-government protesters, who by day’s end Thursday had strengthened their grip on the key central square, Independence Square, or the Maidan.</p><p><b>• Advances by the protesters came at a terrible price,</b> with anywhere from 39 (the health ministry figure) to more than 70 (a field medic’s figure) dying in violence on Thursday. Guardian reporters saw 21 corpses in the square. Most of the deaths appeared to be from gunfire. Pictures and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/blog/2014/feb/20/ukraine-crisis-new-clashes-strain-truce-live-updates#block-53060608e4b0e0e8038da89f\">video</a> emerged of security officers, including snipers, gunning down unarmed protesters. </p><p><b>• Hundreds of protesters have been wounded since fighting broke out Tuesday.</b> At least three security officers died Thursday. Dozens more policemen were captured by protesters and held, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Iskrynka/status/436621451471630337\">apparently unharmed</a>, into the evening. It was the bloodiest day in the history of independent Ukraine.</p><p><b>• A trio of European foreign ministers shuttled on Thursday night between Yanukovych and leaders of the protest. </b>US vice president Joe Biden spoke with Yanukovich on the telephone.

The main thing is to protect human life,” he said. However US officials believe the situation is Kiev reamins extremely volatile and fear a further sudden deterioration in the city.</p><p>The measures being considered are understood to include further visa restrictions on senior Ukranian officials close to Yanukovich who are thought to be responsible for the violence, as well as the possible freezing of assets.</p><p>Barack Obama <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/20/ukraine-crisis-obama-attacks-putin-over-russias-role\">launched an attack on Russia and its president, Vladimir Putin</a>, who he said was failing to respect basic freedoms of the populace in his dealings with the leadership in Ukraine, as well as in Syria.</p><p>Obama, speaking at a North American leaders’ summit in Mexico, said: “You have, in this situation, one country that has clearly been a client state of Russia, another whose government is currently being supported by Russia, where the people obviously have a very different view and vision for their country.”</p><p>A senior State Department official said the “visa sanctions” announced on Wednesday were targeted against individuals deemed responsible for “ordering or otherwise directing human rights abuses related to political repression in Ukraine”.</p><p>“These individuals represent the full chain of command that we consider responsible for ordering security forces to move against [protesters]” the official added.</p><p>The official said the travel sanctions were limited compared to the “much broader and deeper” punitive measures that could be imposed through coordinated action with the EU.</p><p>German chancellor Angela Merkel and French president Fran&ccedil;ois Hollande both signalled on Wednesday that they would back possible sanctions. After the annual Franco-German cabinet meeting in Paris, Hollande said: “Those who are responsible for these deeds have to know that they will certainly be sanctioned.”</p><p>Merkel was more restrained, expressing shock at the scenes of violence but saying there was “no point in having sanctions that hit the civil population” and that “sanctions alone are not enough”.</p><p>She later spoke on the telephone with Russian president Vladimir Putin, and the two agreed to do “everything necessary” to avoid an escalation of the violence.</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-7a0f4189-fd87-453a-9e4a-48efe62e6a37\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/19/1392836588058/d147c4f8-e7f2-4865-9e89-50116082e2ff-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Kiev protest\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>An anti-government protester carrying a tyre walks past a burning vehicle in Sadovaya Street.

Fabius and the two other foreign ministers will be accompanied by EU foreign minister Lady Ashton.</p><p>British prime minister David Cameron condemned the violence on “all sides”, but said Yanukovych had a “particular responsibility to pull back government forces and to de-escalate the situation”. He said: “President Yanukovich should be under no doubt that the world is watching his actions and that those responsible for violence will be held accountable.”</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-a8626268-8c04-475b-a43b-83fb369372a0\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/19/1392836678924/7e35c3f6-1a47-4bab-bb55-796a19889470-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Kiev protester\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>An anti-government protester sits near the barricades on Independence Square. Photograph: Brendan Hoffman/Getty Images</figcaption> </figure> <p>Senior EU officials stressed that no final decision had been taken on sanctions. However the Polish deputy foreign minister, Poitr Serafin, hinted that sanctions were likely. Speaking after the Polish prime minister took part in a conference call with other EU leaders, Serafin said there was now a “unity of views”.</p><p>“The events over the last 24 hours justify the decision of the European Union on sanctions,” he said.</p><p>Ben Rhodes, deputy national security advisor at the White House, said the administration would liaise closely with EU figures to determine the appropriate next steps. Last month, the US imposed some limited travel restrictions against Ukranian officials deemed responsible for the violence. Although the State Department is barred from revealing the identities of the sanctioned individuals, they are understood to include the Ukrainian interior minister, Vitaliy Zakharcheko, and up to 19 others.</p><p>However those sanctions were merely “a shot across the bows”, according to a source close to the administration. The package now under consideration is believed to be much broader, and would rely on EU co-operation.</p><p>Critics accuse large EU member states like Germany and France of failing to work out a coherent and pro-active strategy in their approach to the crisis in the Ukraine. Over the last few weeks the German chancellory and foreign ministry have appeared increasingly at odds over their stance on the crisis.</p><p>Damon Wilson, a former White House official who was closely involved in the introduction of US sanctions against Ukraine in 2004, said the punitive measures were likely to be directed at the coterie of allies and relatives close to Yanukovych who can be linked to the violence.</p><p>“We’re not talking about punishing the policeman on the street, but following the command until you reach the real decision makers,” he said.</p><p>Wilson, now at the Atlantic Council, said the US has been poised to ratchet up the pressure on Ukraine for weeks, but faced resistance from the EU. The violence in recent days appeared to have “shocked the EU system into action” and the White House was likely to want to capitalise on that shift, he added.</p><p>Ukraine’s brutal crackdown has caused deep alarm in the White House, but senior officials are privately sceptical about how much influence the EU and US can bring to bear, particularly in light of Russian support for Yanukovych’s government.<br /></p><p>The situation in Kiev is raising parallels with western impotence in Syria, where Russian support for government suppression of opposition groups is proving equally hard for the US to respond to.<br /></p><p>For its part, Moscow condemned opposition groups in Kiev on Wednesday, urging its leaders to “stop the bloodshed”. A statement released by the Russian foreign ministry underscored its commitment to the Ukranian government. “The Russian side demands that leaders of the [opposition] stop the bloodshed in their country, immediately resume dialogue with the lawful authorities without threats or ultimatums,” it said.</p><p>“Ukraine is a friendly brother state an a strategic partner, and we will use all our influence in order for peace and calm to reign,” the statement added.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/430253304|2014-05-04T12:09:16Z|970f9d7dd5d9475642bceef352b84648f1a17842 -->",

Helena Smith in Athens writes:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>Releasing its quarterly review earlier today, IOBE was unequivocal: in 2014 the recession-hit Greek economy would finally bottom out, it said, but in sharp contrast to official forecasts it could not be excluded that national output would also contract.</p><p>The Athens-based think tank, which was headed by Yannis Stournaras before he took up the post of finance minister in June 2012, said much would depend on the implementation of structural reforms, foreign direct investment and the persistent problem of Greece’s debt overhang – a barrier to international business interest in the country.</p><p>IOBE’s research director, Angelos Tsakanikas, who helped draft the report, told me that while the economy was “moving towards zero” it was possible it could still contract.</p><p>“There is a slowing down of the depression, we are moving towards stability, towards zero, but this [recovery] is fragile,” he said. “If nothing is done with implementing structural reforms, attracting investment and tackling unemployment, the economy could contract … we could, for example, see it hit minus two.” The macro-economic environment would also play a role. “Last year we had recession in the euro zone. If international trade improves it will be easier for Greeks to export.”</p><p>Athens’ pro-bailout coalition government has repeatedly said the economy --- which has shrunk by around 25% since the debt crisis began - will begin to recover in 2014, growing by a predicted 0.6%.</p><p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">Addressing his parliamentary group today, prime minister Antonis Samaras insisted that Greece was about to pull out of recession – at six years its longest in post-war history. “The country has suffered, and is still suffering, but the worst has been avoided and we are now starting to come out of the crisis. Some seem to forget that we stopped the country from collapsing,” the conservative leader told his MPs. “With the help of God and people’s support we will achieve even more.”</span></p><p>After pulling off the biggest fiscal consolidation ever recorded in an OECD country, optimism is such that Stournaras has declared Greece will also re-enter markets in the summer of 2014. But as IOBE, the economic institute, emphasized in its report, there are worries that not enough has been done to implement structural reforms that would improve business by overhauling an archaic public administration and bureaucracy. Raising the same concerns the Greek parliament’s independent budget office announced on Wednesday that priority to fiscal reforms (at the behest of creditors) had ultimately “weakened the [country’s] long-term prospects for recovery.” </p></blockquote> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-01-30T16:16:24.449Z\">at 4.16pm GMT</time></p> </div> <div id=\"block-52ea6ad8e4b082819802e9e4\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-01-30T15:16:37.167Z\">3.16pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p><b>Back in the US, and signs of a slowdown in the housing market.</b></p><p>Pending home sales fell 8.7% in December, according to an index from the National Association of Realtors.

It is unclear however to what extent bad weather explains sales weakness. A few bits of good news are that mortgage rates have stabilised since December, and the number of mortgage applications has also recovered to pre-December figures.</p><p>There is therefore some ground to believe that today’s plunge in pending sales is a one-off that will party be reversed in the coming months.

	"body" : "<p>Five years after the financial crisis, America's super-rich have recovered all their losses to see their wealth reach an all-time high.</p><p>According to <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/luisakroll/2013/09/16/inside-the-2013-forbes-400-facts-and-figures-on-americas-richest/\" title=\"\">Forbes magazine the 400 wealthiest Americans</a> are worth a record $2.02 trillion (£1.4tn), up from $1.7tn in 2012, a collective fortune slightly bigger than Russia's economy. In another sign of fizziness at the top of the economy, the cost to enter the billionaires' club has also gone up to levels not seen since the 2008 crash. In 2013, an aspiring plutocrat needs at least $1.3bn to make the Forbes list – the highest since just before the collapse of Lehman Brothers sent stock markets plummeting.</p><p>Bill Gates has been named as the richest American for the 20th year in a row, with a personal fortune of $72bn. The computer entrepreneur turned philanthropist recovered his position as the world's richest man in May, when he <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/erincarlyle/2013/05/22/bill-gates-is-worlds-richest-bumps-slim/\" title=\"\">overtook mobile phone tycoon Carlos Slim</a>, who had held the top spot for the previous four years.</p><p>Gates, the university drop-outwho founded Microsoft and has given away $28bn since 1994, saw his fortune grow by $6bn since 2012, partly helped by a rise in Microsoft's stock price since August.</p><p>In second place is Warren Buffett, the investor feted for his shrewdness, who recently bought Heinz. Buffett, with a fortune of $58.5bn, was one of the biggest gainers in 2013, which helped him retain his place on the list.  The outspoken founder of software company Oracle, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2009/apr/22/larry-ellison-oracle-sun-microsystems\" title=\"\">Larry Ellison</a>, takes third place with a $41bn fortune.</p><p>The richest woman in the US, and the world, is Christy Walton, who inherited a retail fortune when her husband died in 2005. Walton is estimated to be worth $35.4bn, thanks to her shares in the world's largest supermarket Walmart, which has annual sales of $466bn and employs 2.2 million people worldwide – a workforce bigger than the population of Slovenia. She shares the Walmart fortune with her brother-in law Jim and sister in law Alice, who take sixth and seventh place on the list, with around $33bn each.</p><p>Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg edged into the top 20 after his personal fortune doubled to $19bnas the tech company's stock price revived over the summer, following a wobbly stock market debut in 2012.</p><p>But the social media tycoon is not the youngest on the list. That title belongs to his former dorm mate and Facebook co-founder, Dustin Moskovitz, 29, just a few days younger than Zuckerberg.</p><p>Michael Bloomberg, the mayor of New York who made a fortune with the eponymous news and data company, retains his place as America's richest politician. Bloomberg, worth $31bn and America's 10th richest individual, is due to stand down as mayor in December.</p><p>According to Forbes, one in 10 of the top 400 richest Americans are foreign-born. These include George Soros, the Hungarian-born investor, who 'broke the Bank of England' during the sterling crisis in 1992 and was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/apr/19/reuters-george-soros-obituary-premature-publication\" title=\"\">wrongly pronounced dead by Reuters earlier this year</a>. Others include Ukranian-born serial investor and London dweller Len Blavatnik ($17.8bn); Russian-born Google co-founder Sergey Brin ($24bn) and the Australian-born media tycoon Rupert Murdoch ($13.bn). Forbes reported that 34 people had slipped out of the rich list, including oilman T Boone Pickens, who lost his shirt investing in wind power at a time of falling gas prices, cutting his fortune to $950m, while AOL founder Steve Case saw his fortune fall to $1.2bn as an investment in LivingSocial, a rival to online discount website Groupon, turned sour.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/417440627|2014-05-04T12:09:16Z|78a2da56f3c4586afe985adede511bc0d446e193 -->",

	"body" : "<p>Shortly after 5.15pm on 10 November 2012, a jogger turned into Granville Road, Weybridge, running along the hedge-lined street of one of Britain's wealthiest enclaves. Then, 50m from his home, he staggered into the road and died.</p><p>In the days that followed, Surrey police believed they were dealing with a natural, if unusual, death. Four months on, the passing of 44-year-old <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/dec/09/russian-whistleblower-police-accused-ignoring-evidence\" title=\"\">Alexander Perepilichnyy</a> still remains a mystery. Two post-mortems have proved inconclusive, but the outcome of what Surrey police promise is their &quot;full range&quot; of toxicology tests is imminent.</p><p>To piece together Perepilichnyy's final years is to drill down into the core of Russian criminality, according to one account.</p><p>What we know of Perepilichnyy is slight. In another age he might have been a rocket scientist. Peers called him a &quot;genius&quot;, a Ukranian whiz-kid with an uncanny knack for numbers. His favourite waste of time was, they say, discussing the theories behind <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmogony\" title=\"\">cosmogony</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kondratiev_wave\" title=\"\">Kondratiev waves</a> – the long-term cycles of capitalism. However by the time Perepilichnyy arrived to study at the <a href=\"http://phystech.edu/\" title=\"\">Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology –</a> famous for supplying the brains behind the Soviet space race – Russia's lunar ambitions had curdled with the collapse of communism. Instead Perepilichnyy applied his talents to the world of finance and&nbsp;was, until 2008, a star talent at an asset management firm in Moscow.</p><p>That year, on the other side of Moscow, across Red Square and the brown Moskva river, a rival investment fund to Perepilichnyy's had become engulfed in crisis. <a href=\"http://hermitagefund.com/\" title=\"\">Hermitage Capital</a> was under the guidance of a man called <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/jan/06/england-helps-silence-kremlin-critic\" title=\"\">Bill Browder</a>, a naturalised Briton based in London who had built the investment firm into the largest foreign investor in Russia. But on Christmas Eve 2007, it had discovered itself to be the victim of a&nbsp;huge and sophisticated scam.</p><p>Browder hired Moscow-based lawyer Sergei Magnitsky, to investigate. In July 2008, Magnitsky revealed his findings detailing a&nbsp;web of corruption involving state tax officials and police. Magnitsky allegedly revealed how a gang of detectives, tax inspectors and convicted criminals had planned a 2007 police raid on Hermitage's Moscow office in which officers stole paperwork relating to Browder's companies. These documents were then used to secretly apply for a tax refund worth &pound;144m.</p><p>Following the paper trail, Magnitsky found that the rebate, the largest in Russian history, had been approved at a Moscow tax office in just one day. The vast proceeds had disappeared into a shady network of accounts, according to Magnitsky. After reporting the crime to the authorities, instead of being lauded for his work, Magnitsky was arrested by police and accused of orchestrating the fraud himself. In jail, the 37-year-old was denied medical treatment, handcuffed and beaten by riot troops. He had been in prison awaiting trial for 358 days when on 16 November 2009 doctors found him dead on his cell floor in a pool of urine.</p><p>Perepilichnyy had paid close attention to Magnitsky's fate. Among his client portfolio, he soon realised, were the same senior tax officials Magnitsky had accused of perpetrating the crime against Hermitage Capital. Worse still, Perepilichnyy suspected the vast proceeds of the crime were starting to wash through the foreign corporate bank and Credit Suisse accounts which he managed.</p><p>According to associates, Perepilichnyy was &quot;properly scared&quot; by the death of Magnitsky. Sources say the financier feared he might be implicated in the fraud or similarly victimised if he spoke out. At the end of 2009, Perepilichnyy fled to Britain with his family and what appears to have been a&nbsp;vast fortune, the provenance of which still remains opaque.</p><p>One friend in Moscow, who requested anonymity, said: &quot;Most of all he was an outstanding father. He seemed to be thinking of them 80% of his time.&quot;</p><p>Perepilichnyy believed the exclusive confines of St George's Hill in Surrey would offer sufficient protection for himself, his wife and their two young children, and began renting the six-bedroom Coach House off Granville Road for around &pound;15,000 a month. It was a fortified mansion in an area protected by round-the-clock guards and roadblocks. As one Surrey police source explained: Perepilichnyy lived where &quot;even the security has security&quot;.</p><p>Perepilichnyy adopted a deliberately low profile in the UK. All that changed during the summer of 2010, when he decided to follow the lead set by Magnitsky and handed over evidence and details of the Credit Suisse accounts. Hermitage in turn passed them to the Swiss police, sparking an ongoing international inquiry that has spread to six countries and resulted in the accounts of alleged Russian fraudsters being frozen.</p><p>Perepilichnyy's act put him in grave danger. By the time he went for his final jog last November, the threats against him were mounting. One corrupt official allegedly involved in the fraud against Hermitage warned &quot;the financial wizard&quot; to stop running scared in England because he owed money to &quot;scores of creditors&quot;. Even the alleged killers of Litvinenko joined the long list of those with a potential motive. One of the suspects wanted for trial over the murder of the former KGB spy is among those understood to have launched legal action against Perepilichnyy, accusing him of failing to pay back debts. Perepilichnyy told business contacts in London that Moscow police agents had informed him his name was on the &quot;hit list&quot; of Chechen assassin groups for hire and that they had accumulated a dossier with details of his life in Surrey.</p><p>Rumours persist that he was part of the fraud against Hermitage, although his friends insist it was naivety, not greed, that brought him into danger. &quot;He was a tragic hero,&quot; says one. &quot;He could have been a&nbsp;genius professor of maths at a different time and place. He became followed, threatened and put into a corner.&quot;</p><p>Yet even at the end, Perepilichnyy had enough courage to flout the death threats and travel abroad. On the day he died, he had just returned from Paris after a three-day visit. During his sojourn in the French capital he'd booked two hotels, but it is unclear why he went to Paris or who he met there.</p><p>Investigators working for Hermitage claim the deaths of Magnitsky and Perepilichnyy are the latest in a series of suspicious deaths. They claim at least five other men who have died in strange circumstances had links to individuals they allege were involved in the fraud. The investigators paint a picture of a&nbsp;shadowy network of corrupt police, tax officials and criminals dubbed the Klyuev group, which is, they claim, headed by the bald, heavy-set figure of businessman Dmitry Klyuev. A spokesman for Klyuev, who is a convicted fraudster, describes the suggestion that such a&nbsp;group exists as a &quot;fabrication and a lie&quot;. The spokesman pours scorn on the idea of a string of suspicious deaths and adds that Browder, whom he describes as a&nbsp;&quot;corporate blackmailer&quot;, is running a highly defamatory PR campaign.</p><figure data-media-id=\"gu-image-405726788\"><img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2013/3/13/1363172796303/Funeral-ceremony-of-Serge-008.jpg\" alt=\"Funeral ceremony of Sergei Magnitsky in Moscow\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /><figcaption>Death in custody: Sergei Magnitsky’s funeral. In jail he had been handcuffed and beaten by riot troops. Photograph: Mikhail Voskresenskiy/Reuters</figcaption></figure><p>The first unusual death, according to the Hermitage investigators, came in 2005. Sergei Albaev, a former KGB officer, worked for Klyuev as a&nbsp;chauffeur. Documents from a&nbsp;Moscow court case record his wife's worry: &quot;He became more secretive, agitated, and kept saying he had problems at work.&quot; Unknown to her, Albaev, along with his boss Klyuev, had been accused of helping orchestrate a &pound;1.1bn fraud against Russia's biggest iron-ore producer, a criminal act that Hermitage lawyers allege was a forerunner to the attack on them.</p><p>On 3 March 2005, before Albaev could plead his innocence in court, he went on a&nbsp;business trip. He called his wife, saying he was in the Rostov region, 700km south of Moscow. On 8 April she received a call from a man she did not recognise. Her husband had died, said the stranger. Albaev's death certificate states he died from heart failure. Albaev was only 39. Although it was true Albaev liked a&nbsp;drink, smoked and weighed about 150kg, his family believes his death seemed sudden. Even now, his wife and child have no idea who he was with when he died or what he was doing.</p><p>Within weeks came another death. Alexei Alexanov had also been implicated as a key player in the attempted iron-ore fraud. Little is known about Alexanov other than, according to court transcripts, that he had known Klyuev since 1991. During a pre-trial interview, Alexanov insisted he would never sign fraudulent contracts, claiming that the implicating signatures looked nothing like his handwriting. Alexanov never had another chance to contest his innocence. Soon after, he too died in the Rostov region of heart failure. He was 46.</p><p>The next death wasn't so much strange as mistimed, according to investigators. It occurred in the wake of the fraud against Hermitage Capital. In the period after Magnitsky uncovered the crime, and before his arrest, the Russian interior ministry launched an investigation into his claims that quickly yielded a&nbsp;culprit. On the face of it, Oktai Gasanov from Azerbaijan seemed an unusual criminal mastermind. The 58-year-old appears to have been little more than a lowly security guard at a Moscow trading centre. But it is Gasanov's death certificate that raises the most questions. Gasanov died two months and 24 days before the actual fraud was committed. Had he been framed by police officers alleged to have been part of the syndicate that targeted Hermitage?</p><p>Then there was Valery Kurochkin – a&nbsp;bumbling alcoholic, according to police records, yet named by tax officials as the inheritor of Hermitage Capital. He never had time to indulge his new-found wealth: allegedly having taken a&nbsp;midnight train to Ukraine with five of the fraud suspects, the 48-year-old was found dead close to Boryspil international airport, near Kiev, on 30 April. His death certificate cites cirrhosis as the cause of death.</p><p>Then came Semyon Korobeinikov. Magnitsky had traced money from the Hermitage fraud to a Russian bank called USB which Klyuev had once owned but which had apparently been sold in 2006 to Korobeinikov. Before the 57-year-old could be questioned, Korobeinikov elected – according to the official report – to visit a&nbsp;Moscow construction site in September 2008 and climb a half-finished luxury penthouse. &quot;Korobeinikov took himself to a&nbsp;big height,&quot; says the police inquiry's peculiar explanation. &quot;His heart felt poorly, he fell down, obtaining injuries incompatible with life.&quot;</p><p>Klyuev is robust in his rejection of the claims made by Hermitage, saying that the company, and Browder, is trying to frame him. &quot;To completely fool the public, Browder hints at various 'suspicious' deaths, cynically describing them in the context of… Dmitry Klyuev,&quot; says Klyuev's spokesman. The &quot;Klyuev group&quot;, he says, was invented by Browder and the allegations are &quot;unworthy and low&quot;. The spokesman accuses Browder of extensive criminal activity himself and points out that Browder is facing charges in Russia, in a case that was due to start last week.</p><p>As diplomats in Moscow and London wait nervously for the outcome of the toxicology assessments on Perepilichnyy, many believe his name may join Magnitsky's as a&nbsp;central source of friction between Russia and the west. In December the US Senate passed the Magnitsky Act, which imposes a visa ban and sanctions on 60 Russians implicated in the fraud and lawyer's death. The act prompted Cold War-style posturing and tit-for-tat sanctions, including President <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/vladimir-putin\" title=\"\">Vladimir Putin</a>'s ban on Americans adopting Russian children. Russia is pressing ahead with the posthumous prosecution of Magnitsky for tax evasion, the trial that also indicts Browder.</p><p>This prosecution has drawn widespread international condemnation and forced the European Parliament to describe it as a &quot;violation of international and national laws&quot;. The last precedent for the posthumous trial dates back to medieval times when, in 897, the then pope held a trial of his predecessor, whose body was dug up and propped up on a&nbsp;chair in the papal court.</p><p>Klyuev claims the case will ensure Browder's &quot;own crimes cannot remain hidden. [He] should honestly reveal all the accusations made against him and explain his behaviour in each specific instance.&quot;</p><p>Whether the Klyuev group exists or not, many of its alleged members appear to like London. Lawyers for Hermitage claim that analysis of flight records reveal that 61 flights between Moscow and London have carried at least one member of the so-called group since Magnitsky exposed the fraud and have identified to the <a href=\"http://www.sfo.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">Serious Fraud Office</a> individuals who they say have laundered the fraudulent money.</p><p>If suspicions about Perepilichnyy's death were to be confirmed, the broader concern among the intelligence services is that Russian hitmen could be freely entering the UK. Hermitage employees have received at least 11 death threats, mainly text messages from phones traced to Russia. The firm's London staff report being put under surveillance by strangers, and many now follow elaborate security routines.</p><p>Former foreign minister <a href=\"http://www.chris-bryant.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Chris Bryant</a>, a&nbsp;Labour MP, is among those perturbed that elements of the Russian mafia may be able to move freely about in London. &quot;Undoubtedly there is a security risk in Britain at the moment,&quot; says Bryant. &quot;There are a number of Russian operatives acting in the UK – the long arm of Russian vendettas seems to stretch over here.&quot; Browder has no doubt that he is a&nbsp;marked man.</p><p>Publicly, at least, no one is any wiser as to why Perepilichnyy dropped dead at the end of his jog. The ongoing police investigation is liaising with MI5, and Swiss and Russian authorities – but the latter relationship has been particularly difficult since <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Litvinenko\" title=\"\">Alexander Litvinenko</a>'s murder in 2006 in London. Perepilichnyy himself allegedly owed money to Dmitry Kovtun, one of the prime suspects wanted by British prosecutors over the poisoning. But senior Whitehall sources are keenly aware that the cause of Perepilichnyy's death has potentially seismic ramifications. If it is proven that Perepilichnyy was murdered, then no one is safe.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/405492797|2014-05-04T12:09:16Z|ac0f30adec75453acbacb56306e5308c74f55c73 -->",

	"body" : "<p>The first obvious blow to Greek tourism came when the country <a href=\"http://www.raileurope.co.uk/Home/Corporate/RELBlog/tabid/2290/EntryId/39/Greece-suspends-international-trains.aspx\" title=\"\">suspended international rail services</a> 16 months ago. Since then, it's gone right off the rails. Before <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/jun/18/greek-election-antonis-samaras-coalition\" title=\"\">last weekend's election</a>, nightmare scenarios were painted in the media of food shortages, street protests and a withdrawal from the euro. Not exactly images designed to encourage Britons to book a holiday. While the focus was on Athens, the Greek islands were quietly going about their business – albeit with many empty tables and rooms but with a warm welcome to tourists who had travelled there. With the latest crisis averted, what does the rest of the summer hold for Greece? Will it be bargains all round, empty beaches and retsina on the house?</p><h2>Is it a Greek tourism tragedy?</h2><p>Not quite, although numbers are definitely sagging. More than 2.3 million Britons visited in 2011 – but bookings are down 11% so far this season. If sustained, that equates to 250,000 fewer British visits this year.</p><p>George Tsakiris, president of the Hellenic Chamber of Hotels, estimates that 500,000 summer bookings normally made in early June were lost because of uncertainty ahead of the election. Since then, Sunvil Holidays and other UK tour operators have reported a surge of bookings for travel during school holidays. Barrie Neilson, owner of Sailing Holidays, says: \"We have an extremely slow July but August and September look reasonably OK.\"</p><h2>Who's joining us on the beach?</h2><p><a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/05/19/thomas-cook-idUSL5E8GJ21520120519\" title=\"\">Reports say </a>that only half the normal number of Germans are visiting this year, with many fearing a negative reaction from locals. Such a decline in numbers will particularly affect Crete.</p><p>Many tourists from the old eastern bloc are now going to Greece but they tend to opt for \"all inclusive\" places and don't get out into local communities like the British. According to Neilson: \"We're noticing a lot less people about than normal. The biggest effect for locals is the disappearance of local Greek tourists, who would come to the coast from the hinterland.\"</p><h2>What sort of welcome can we expect to receive?</h2><p>Open arms and bear hugs. Chris Wright, managing director of GIC The Villa Collection, says that it's like the Greece of 20 years ago – very friendly and very welcoming.</p><p>Jo Marsden of Whitchurch, Dorset, returned this week from a holiday on Paxos. \"The spirit of the proprietors was relaxed and extremely affable. They couldn't do enough for the guests, who were mostly British,\" she says.</p><p>\"This sense of hospitality extended to all the island's inhabitants. Prices were comparatively low from restaurants to boat trips and taxis. Our impression was that there was no thought of capitalising on the current Greek crisis.\"</p><h2>What are the prices like?</h2><p>As Marsden observes, prices in hotels and restaurants have come down across the board. There has been a de facto devaluation in Greece even though they are still in the euro. As the local population is forced to spend less, so prices come down. However, Keren Levy, who was in Paros the week before last, said: \"Hotel and restaurant prices were not noticeably lower. Regular faces, the yearly visitors, seemed willing to pay them.\"</p><p>Noel Josephides, owner of Sunvil, has been selling holidays to Greece since 1970 and says the oversupply of hotels and airline seats also means the price of a package holiday is lower this summer: \"During the boom years, too many hotels were built, and too many villas, too many apartments,, and now the price is being paid. Nothing is ever full because there is so much out there – and though tour operators have cut back, the no-frills airlines have poured on capacity so they, too, are rarely full.\"</p><h2>What about the strikes?</h2><p>With Greece so dependent on tourism, there's even a chance of less disruption to travel plans than usual this summer. According to Eftichios Vassilakis, vice-chair of Greek carrier Aegean Airlines, there have been no strikes in Athens in the past four months, \"which is much better than last year\".</p><p>A spokeswoman for the Association of Independent Tour Operators (Aito) in the UK said the same: \"There have been fewer strikes this year than is the norm, and indeed fewer than in Italy.\"</p><h2>What are the Greeks doing to bring us back?</h2><p>The <a href=\"http://www.greeka.com/greece/greece-tourism-offices.htm\" title=\"\">Greek Tourist Board</a> has set up a website and is appealing to social-media-savvy volunteer supporters to inspire goodwill. The interactive site – <a href=\"http://www.truegreece.org/\" title=\"\">TrueGreece.org</a> – is designed to share positive travel experiences and help downplay any negativity.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-392015576'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2012/6/22/1340359348414/parthenon-acropolis-athen-001.jpg' alt='parthenon acropolis athens greece' width='460' height='259' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>The Parthenon in Athens. Photograph: Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>Not everyone is impressed. Josephides said: \"In the best of times, no action is taken quickly. When the minister (of tourism) came to the UK in February, we met and said that Greece had to go on the offensive because there is so much bad publicity.</p><p>\"It is too little, too late – but we have got to help regenerate tourism. We are linked to Greece and our fortunes are tied.\"</p><p>He has contributed 20&nbsp;airline seats to send \"ambassadors\" to Greece to spread the goodwill message. More co-operation from other private sector partners is being sought. Expect sightings of several minor celebrities eager to travel and help the cause this summer.</p><p>One positive start would be for the Greek National Tourist Office in the UK to use social media itself: its Twitter account has not updated since 20&nbsp;October last year.</p><h2>What about the currency?</h2><p>It is nearly four years since the pound bought you so much in the eurozone. It's now around €1.25 to £1 and, on current trend, will appreciate slightly more before the school holidays.</p><p>Thomas&nbsp;Cook suggests that when changing sterling for euros, you ask for smaller denominations: €5, €10&nbsp;and €20 notes. This is because, should Greece pull out of the euro – which seems unlikely in the short term – the interim currency will be existing euro notes with a corner clipped, which will be worth 30-40%&nbsp;less. The thinking is that you will lose more on a&nbsp;transaction with a €50&nbsp;or higher note.</p><p>But do pack a credit or debit card – and a prepaid euro debit card, which incurs no charge at an ATM and is widely accepted by retailers. For more advice visit <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2012/jun/15/how-to-holiday-euro-less-greece\" title=\"\">guardian.co.uk/money</a>.</p><h2>Should I take cash?</h2><p>Some retail outlets and cafes are already asking for cash rather than accepting cards. Sir David Miers, a former British ambassador to Greece, who recently returned from a trip to Corfu, said: \"There is a fear among Corfiots of what will happen if Greece has to revert to the drachma. ATMs might cease to operate while there is uncertainty about the currency. The tendency for people to want settlement in cash rather than by credit card might increase. But for tourists who have plenty of hard currency in their wallets, that should not be a problem.\"</p><p>Dana Facaros, author of the Cadogan Guide to the Greek Islands, warned: \"It is not a problem (yet) on the big islands such as Corfu, but I can imagine you might get caught out on a small island, especially one with only one or two ATMs. Greece isn't having a bank run, more of a slow motion bank walk.\"</p><p>Journalist Sean O'Hagan, who was in the region last week, said: \"We found ATMs that didn't have any money, and other holidaymakers told us of restaurants and cafes that were just accepting cash.\"</p><h2>What sort of holiday should I&nbsp;book to be helpful?</h2><p>Greece needs you this summer: one in five of the working population is employed in tourism, and the money the industry brings in accounts for 17% of GDP. There are two ways to look at this: book your own hotel or B&amp;B direct and the money stays in Greece. But you still have to buy your flight and that money doesn't, unless you choose to fly Olympic or Aegean Airways.</p><p>Or you can buy a package. They are undeniably cheap. Olympic Holidays has just cut prices, by 25%, for the first half of July. Buy from an international operator such as Tui, which sells into its own hotels, and little money will stay in Greece.</p><p>If you buy from a tour firm that specialises in Greece, a lot more will go into the local economy, as has happened for years. Sailing Holidays has been operating for 25 years and runs 178 boats around the Greek islands; Sunvil has been supporting Greek holidays since 1970. Both they and other specialists, such as Ionian Island Holidays, will always continue to support hoteliers – it's their business, but also a lifelong passion.</p><p>Barrie Neilson of Sailing Holidays said: \"I've had hoteliers saying we're saving their homes this year. We support the little guys.\"</p><p>These firms are also Atol-bonded, and will guarantee your holiday should things go awry with the euro, with either a refund or an alternative holiday. If you travel independently, the risk is yours.</p><p>Personally? I'd go for a flight to Athens (currently around £200 on easyJet) and a ferry from Piraeus. Then, in an old-fashioned way, book a room from the gaggle of apartment owners who will meet the boat in the harbour. There are lots of stories this summer of rooms for under £40&nbsp;a night. If that's a bit too risky for you, book independent accommodation before you go (see below).</p><h2>Which areas would benefit the most from tourism?</h2><p>There is an argument that northern Greece will benefit most. In February 2011, international rail services to Greece were halted to save money, cutting off routes from Turkey, Bulgaria and Serbia. It means the second city of Salonika and the region around Mount Olympus are cut off from tourism as few head north of Athens.</p><p>Greek travel blogger John Malathronas says: \"Those islands with airports such as Corfu, Crete or Mykonos will always be fine: they will always have tourists. But the north and the smaller islands will suffer this summer.\"</p><p>Some islands are being boosted by an influx of Russians and Ukranians, while Santorini and Corfu – traditional high-value holiday spots for Britons – are also still selling well, particularly pricey luxurious villas. Added Malathronas: \"A friend in Santorini tells me the island is busy – and this year is also seeing a lot of Chinese visitors coming in off the cruise ships.\"</p><p>So go for smaller, barely known islands which are more likely to be struggling.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-392015577'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2012/6/22/1340359175514/Agii-Pandes-Chora-Amorgos-001.jpg' alt='Agii Pandes, Chora, Amorgos' width='460' height='517' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Chora, capital of little visited Amorgos, in the Cyclades.

From Manchester to Crete it was about the same, or from around £140 in July, for flexible departure days.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.cheapflights.co.uk/?source=intl-CFUS-flag-GB\" title=\"\"><strong>Cheapflights.com</strong></a> said it had seen a rise in searches for flights to Athens this week , 16% up on the previous week, and has summer flights from around £158 return from the UK.</p><h2>What if I want to book a&nbsp;package or find a deal?</h2><p>Going with a specialist tour operator who has worked with local Greek businesses for years is a more ethical option than a major operator who is more profit-driven and possibly exploitative of people desperate to fill rooms. Plus many have access to airfares and room rates not available to individual travellers, and you get the peace of mind of financial protection.</p><p>Start at <a href=\"http://www.aito.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><strong>aito.com</strong></a>, which includes 40&nbsp;Greek holiday specialists as well as accommodation including villas with pool to B&amp;Bs, apartments and rooms above tavernas.

Departing on 6 July, seven nights on Skopelos at Metochi Villa with private pool, three bedrooms, flights from Gatwick or Manchester, transfers, car hire and welcome hamper costs £587pp (£392pp off).</p><h2>I've booked but I'm not sure. Can I cancel?</h2><p>No. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) has no warnings on its website about travel, so if you've booked, there is no legal reason for an operator to give you a refund. If worried, book through an Atol-backed tour operator so that if trouble breaks out, you will be evacuated. If trouble breaks out before travel and the FCO changes its travel advice, then you will be offered a&nbsp;refund or alternative holiday.</p><h2>How can I travel there more ethically?</h2><p>Eat out nightly, make sure any produce you buy is grown in Greece, not imported, enjoy a drink or two, explore the shops and buy local crafts. Travel around and try different places to spread your money.</p><p>A new website, launched last month, encourages visitors to explore Athens with a local.  <a href=\"http://www.dopios.com/\" title=\"\"><strong>Dopios.com</strong></a>, which means local in Greek, lists 47&nbsp;residents of Athens who will guide you around, from eating to walks to nightlife – even on the back of a motorbike. The residents charge for the tour. For example, Lila Tzamousi offers an all-day guided group trip to the island of Aegina for £40 a head: after the cost of the boat and food, she makes around £7. Tzamousi said: \"Despite the situation, we never lose the fun and our sense of hospitality.\"</p><p>How do I learn about the Greek economic crisis first hand?</p><p>If you don't want to just lie on the beach pretending everything's OK and would rather get to the bottom of what's up with Greece, turn to <strong>Political Tours</strong> (0843 289 2349, <a href=\"http://www.politicaltours.com/tours/greece-the-euro\" title=\"\">politicaltours.com/tours/greece-the-euro</a>), which offers trips that allow travellers to experience current affairs first-hand.</p><p>Among its programme, which also includes expert-led trips to North Korea, Libya, Northern Ireland, Kosovo and London's own City, is a one-off trip in August, which examines the Greek sovereign debt crisis and asks what next for the eurozone, through talks by leading analysts, NGOs, local leaders and ordinary people, on the island of Samos and in Athens. Visits include Syntagma Square, where demonstrators massed, Ermou Street where it was once impossible to find a shop to rent but now many stand vacant, Perama shipyard, once a vital engine of the Greek economy and Corinth, a farming area, as in the past two years tens of thousands of Greeks have chosen to become farmers. The trip runs 25&nbsp;August–2&nbsp;September and costs £2,750 (single supplement £250), excluding flights.</p><h2>How can I keep up to date with what's happening?</h2><p>Before travelling, catch up on a number of websites that host live blogging from Greece.

Belgium said it was following suit and that Tymoshenko and other members of her government now in prison should be allowed medical treatment and visits.</p><p>Eugenia Tymoshenko said her mother was badly beaten up on the evening of 20 April when prison guards arrived in her cell to transfer her to hospital. Tymoshenko suffers from severe back pain. She is refusing to see doctors provided by Ukraine's ministry of health and instead insists on treatment by German doctors or her own physician.</p><p>Three people – the vice-head of the prison colony and two guards – came to the cell late at night and tried to forcibly drag her away, her daughter said. \"They started moving towards her and surrounded her bed. They first moved everyone from the building and removed her neighbour. My mother felt these were the last minutes of her life.</p><p>\"They grabbed a thick woollen blanket from her bed, pulling her off the bed. She managed to stick her hand out and resisted, protecting her life. The vice-head then punched her in the stomach.</p><p>\"She couldn't breath after the punch. She started screaming, when they were bringing her out of the building. She passed out in the ambulance. She recovered conscious in hospital. She refused everything. She took only painkillers.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-389764855'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/5/2/1335981822882/Evgenia-Tymoshenko-004.jpg' alt='Evgenia Tymoshenko' width='220' height='132' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Eugenia Tymoshenko.

She was now on the 13th day of a hunger strike, her daughter said.</p><p>Ukrainian prosecutors claim Tymoshenko's injuries were self-inflicted. Eugenia Tymoshenko claimed her mother's cell was under 24-hour video surveillance, and said the authorities could release tapes proving what had happened.</p><p>On Sunday Angela Merkel announced that she and her cabinet would not attend any matches played by Germany in Ukraine unless Tymoshenko was released. Germany's first game, against the Netherlands on 13 June, will be played in Kharkiv, the eastern city where Tymoshenko is incarcerated.</p><p>On Tuesday the US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, called for Tymoshenko to be freed. The president of the European commission, José Manuel Barroso, and the commissioner for justice, Viviane Reding, have said they will not be travelling to Ukraine. The diplomatic fiasco represents an embarrassment for Uefa, European football's governing body.</p><p>It is unclear whether David Cameron will follow Germany's lead. The Foreign Office says it is \"reviewing the situation\". England will play all three of their group stage matches in Ukraine, one in Kiev and two in the eastern city of Donetsk.</p><p>Eugenia Tymoshenko declined to give advice to Downing Street but said the EU had to bring \"all instruments\" to bear on Ukraine's president, Viktor Yanukovych.</p><p>\"I think European leaders can't stand next to someone who is allowing these kinds of repressions. Standing next to him would look like support,\" she said. \"Yanukovych could have solved this crisis months ago and stopped court proceedings. It's in his power to find a solution.\"</p><p>A Ukrainian court jailed Tymoshenko late last year for seven years following what her supporters and the EU say was a blatantly manipulated show trial.</p><p>Berlin has been negotiating for months with Ukraine's government to allow Tymoshenko to be treated in Germany. Her daughter said it would be very difficult for her mother to abandon Ukraine and her life in politics.</p><p>She said Yanukovych was probably persecuting her mother out of revenge. She said Yanukovych \"felt personally angry and frustrated\" after his attempts to rig Ukraine's 2004 presidential election backfired, sparking the pro-western Orange revolution. Yanukovych took power in 2010 after an election regarded internationally as fair, but since then, Eugenia Tymoshenko said, he had embarked on a course of repression and physical violence against his political opponents.</p><p>\"As Yulia's daughter, as a Ukrainian, I detest what Yanukovych is doing. It's obviously an illegal attempt to keep his main opponents out of the political game.\" She predicted his government would become more harsh in the runup to parliamentary elections in October.</p><p>There has been no comment from Yanukovych's office on the prospect of an EU-wide boycott of Euro 2012, but Ukranian officials have reacted sharply. This week the foreign ministry spokesman, Oleg Voloshin, suggested Germany was \"reanimating the methods of the cold war\" and said Euro 2012 was about football, not politics. \"It's impossible to solve any political issues through boycotting sporting events,\" he said.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/389567855|2014-05-04T12:09:16Z|96eab4d10e0a306536ed1651fbe7e7d78771f3b5 -->",

	"body" : "<p>In Tripoli's medina, young men stand in the shadows of the narrow alleyways fingering rolls of grubby banknotes, offered in exchange for euros or dollars. \"You want money?\" they quietly ask the few westerners still in the city, which has seen sporadic coalition bombardment for the past two weeks.</p><p>How much, we ask one. There is a pause before he settles on 190 Libyan dinars for $100 – a substantial difference to the official exchange rate of around 120. How's business, how are things generally, we inquire. \"Bad,\" he says, eyes twitching from side to side, wary of the ubiquitous government minders and spies. \"The banks are closed, there is no work.\" He declines to say more.</p><p>In the old city souk around him, many shops are shuttered. This is the area of the medina selling jewellery and copperware; in times of conflict and uncertainty, few people's impulse is to shop for decorative adornments.</p><p>One black market money-changer does not represent a city, but there have been other pointers to economic insecurity arising from Libya's political and military crisis. A week ago there were long, chaotic queues at every open petrol station, with motorists and pedestrians carrying containers waiting for hours for fuel.</p><p>The government blamed this on panic buying and stockpiling rather than any real shortage of fuel. This week the regime cut the already heavily subsidised price of fuel to boost confidence, and queues have diminished. Early in the crisis, the Gaddafi regime also distributed a lump sum of 500 dinars to each family to help with essentials and, no doubt, to reinforce loyalty.</p><p>Libya imports about 75% of its food, but there is no evidence in the markets of a shortage of meat, fish and vegetables – although an olive-seller in the medina whispered that dairy products such as milk, cheese and yoghurt were scarce. The subsidised prices appear to have largely remained stable or risen only fractionally.</p><p>In the covered fish market Osama Ahmed Omar, 38, said he and his fellow fishermen had almost doubled their hours at sea \"to help the country at this time\". In the presence of a government minder and a government-appointed translator, he told us: \"We're working more so people can be happy and to send a message to the world. It is very important that the British, French and Americans see there is no problem.\"</p><p>Trying to locate the real mood of ordinary Tripolitans is impossible when accompanied by regime officials and very difficult on rare independent forays to try to test opinion. Libyans, conditioned by four decades of restrictions on freedom of expression, are wary and suspicious of talking to strangers.</p><p>On an officially sanctioned reporting trip, Sabria Mohammed, a 50-year-old grandmother who had decorated her hands with henna in celebration of the rebels' retreat, insisted there were no problems with shortages of food or fuel. \"The only problem is the [coalition] bombing,\" she said.</p><p>Kheria Zaid, a 42-year-old in receipt of 500 dinars a month in government benefits as a divorcee, out shopping for her family's evening meal, said prices were stable, although perhaps the cost of meat had risen by half a dinar a kilo. \"The only problem is that the Guide [Gaddafi] should stay in good health,\" she said.</p><p>But, according to the Times of Malta, evacuated migrant workers disembarking from a Ukranian navy ship this week reported increased tension in the capital over food and fuel shortages. And at St Francis Catholic church in Tripoli, which has cut its normal five multilingual services a day to two as its expatriate congregation has dwindled, worshippers spoke of economic difficulties caused by the conflict.</p><p>Joey, a Filipino restaurant owner, has closed his business because so few people are venturing out in the evenings, when gunfire can be heard across the city. Kenneth, a Nigerian florist, said most weddings had been cancelled and most hotels, which constitute a significant proportion of his clientele, had closed.</p><p>A new Marriott hotel, whose striking display of zig-zag lighting across its facade is visible from much of the city at night, opened on 15 February, the day unrest broke out in Benghazi. Now its 370 five-star rooms are mothballed and its largely migrant workforce has been evacuated.</p><p>Hospitals and schools appear to be functioning, but a Polish surgeon based at the city's central hospital said doctors were beginning to run low on some drugs.</p><p>It may be the case that the impact of the political and military crisis and international sanctions, plus the exodus of hundreds of thousands of migrant workers, has yet to be felt in Tripoli. But as the weeks go by with no obvious resolution to the crisis in sight, the blithe insistence by regime officials that life in Tripoli is continuing as normal may become harder to maintain.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/373469753|2014-05-04T12:09:17Z|3d543bf81193e4ee4ef98a8395939a5898be5ebe -->",

	"body" : "<h2><a href=\"http://www.tinyurl.com/eurosweden\">Sweden – the camp one</a></h2><p>Language buffs might be drawn to the Eurovision Song Contest for its cultural plurality. A statistician might revel in the quirks of its voting system. A homesick expatriate might place an emotional stake in the success of his or her homeland, however justifiably (most former Soviet or Yugoslav republics) or foolishly (all points west of Prague). But for Britons, the contest represents one of the last outposts of that most devalued of currencies: high camp. And in this year's finals in Moscow, the camp comes no higher than Sweden's daring fusion of light opera and throbbing eurodance.</p><p>Graced with the voice of a song-thrush, the shoulders of a stevedore and the lung power of an industrial dehumidifier, Malena Ernman is an internationally acclaimed mezzo-soprano with serious chops: she's played Carmen and Dido, sung at Vienna and Glyndebourne, and worked with Barenboim and Rattle. Tomorrow night, equipped with little more than a feathery frock, a souped-up karaoke machine and a mask-flaunting dance troupe, she faces an audience of 100 million, whose unqualified respect might not be forthcoming. If camp's comedic power resides in the gap between intention and effect, then the gap here is one in which we may all gratefully luxuriate.</p><h2><a href=\"http://www.tinyurl.com/euromalta\">Malta – the plucky one</a></h2><p>No country is more eager to win Eurovision than Malta, and no country has displayed greater loyalty to the hapless UK - even to the point of awarding the full douze points to Scooch, in 2007. There's no getting away from it: we owe them.</p><p>With that in mind, you are urged to gaze charitably upon the delightful Chiara, who returns to the finals for a third attempt. Granted, there's nothing immediately ear-grabbing about What If We, an old-fashioned ballad that mires itself in metaphysical riddles (\"What if we could be free? Mystify our wisdom in time and one day we'll see\"). But know this also: Chiara has form. She came third in 1998, second in 2005, and her hardcore Eurovision fanbase adore her still-can-do spirit. Underestimate her at your peril.</p><h2><a href=\"http://www.tinyurl.com/euroturkey\">Turkey – the toddler-talking one</a></h2><p>Times may change, but a Eurovision cleansed of lyrical toddler-talk would be a bleak place indeed. With this in mind, we must commend its few remaining exponents. Moldova has us merrily shai-lalai-ing; Armenia chips in with some sturdy takituk-takituk-takituk-ing; and Germany goes the whole hog, inviting us variously to \"do the skiddly skiddly bo\", the \"skiddly buffely boodely bump\" and most winningly of all, the \"ring-a-bing bing\". </p><p>But it's to Turkey's Hadise that we must turn for a toddler song title - first pausing to admire her way with a double-edged compliment. \"No one can kiss like you do - as if it's your profession,\" she purrs. Surely there are better ways to a man's heart than suggesting he snogs like a rent boy?</p><p>D&uuml;m Tek Tek is the hotly tipped, rump-shaking ditty in question, its title an onomatopoeic representation of Hadise's wild, unfettered heartbeat. In other words, it's a Turkish version of Boom Bang-a-Bang. And for that alone, we must salute it.</p><h2><a href=\"http://www.tinyurl.com/eurobosherz\">Bosnia and Herzegovina – the war-weary one</a></h2><p>There's a certain strain of butched-up Balkan bombast that always does well at Eurovision, to the bafflement of those deprived of sufficient opportunities to acquire a taste for it. This year it's the Bosnian rock band Regina who look set to galvanise the former Yugoslav voting bloc into phone-stabbing action. Bistra Voda (Clear Water) couples a stirring tune with poetic, impressionistic lyrics and distinct military overtones; you could imagine it performed by a weary, battle-scarred marching band, still defiant in defeat. Watch out for a striking Socialist Realist tableau vivant, in which the players adopt the noble, faraway gazes of Worker Hero archetypes. Or are they merely refugees from a Sarajevan production of Les Miserables? It's hard to decide. </p><h2><a href=\"http://www.tinyurl.com/euronorway\">Norway – the bloc-straddling one</a></h2><p>Where football leads, Eurovision follows. As countries of birth or residence become ever less relevant when it comes to assigning players to teams (Ronan Keating has co-written this year's Danish entry, for instance), cynical tongues have seen fit to wag at Norway's apparent outsourcing of their entry to Alexander Rybak, a Byelorussian. What neater way could there be to unite two of the major voting blocs, the Slavs and the Scandinavians?</p><p>In fairness, Rybak has lived in Norway since he was four, giving him every right to assert his Norwegian identity. During the fortnight of rehearsals, press conferences and parties that have preceded tomorrow's finals, he has presented himself as a model of accessible, unassuming charm - and it's these qualities that make his self-penned song Fairytale such a strong tip to win. Indeed, it has been the universally acknowledged red-hot favourite for so long that its supremacy has rather deadened the fun of trying to pick a winner.</p><p>Stringed instruments are big news at this year's Eurovision - nobody quite knows why - and Rybak's nimble fiddle breaks lie at the heart of Fairytale's appeal. Granted, his irrepressible sunniness does clash with the lyrical despair (\"I don't care if I lose my mind, I'm already cursed\"), and there's an awkward tautology in the opening line (\"Years ago, when I was younger\") which sits oddly with the winsome boyishness he projects - but Rybak has just turned 23, and is hence clearly entitled to have a \"past\". Fairytale's spell palls swiftly on repeated exposure, but it would be churlish not to wish him well.</p><h2><a href=\"http://www.tinyurl.com/eurogreek\">Greece – the age-inappropriate one</a></h2><p>We last saw Sakis Rouvas at the 2006 finals in Athens, as presenter rather than contestant. Those who recall his graceful, high-wire-assisted descent on to the Athens stage will be heartened by this year's continuation of the \"man in flight\" theme - although this time round, as the Greek entrant, his execution is altogether more earthbound. In other words, Sakis gets to jump off his podium a lot, barking \"Fly!\" upon each descent, with a misplaced optimism that would have shamed Icarus. </p><p>A fully fledged heartthrob at home, Sakis seems blissfully unburdened by self-doubt - but at 37, his age might just be starting to catch up with him. So as you watch him shimmy and thrust, playing eternal peek-a-boo with midriff and man-cleavage alike, you can't help questioning the age-appropriateness of all this galumphing around. Still, there's plenty on stage to distract us. The posing platform briefly becomes a conveyor belt, before morphing into a giant sunbed, upon whose half-open lid Sakis triumphantly perches. Unmissable stuff.</p><h2><a href=\"http://www.tinyurl.com/euroukrainian\">Ukraine – the kinky one</a></h2><p>In a comparatively unchallenging year for the Eurovision props department, it falls to Ukraine's frankly alarming Svetlana Loboda to go the whole hog, bolstered by an equally arresting troupe of swarthy hunks and \"anti-crisis girls\". Brace yourselves for a riot of eye-popping gimmickry - from the so-called \"Hell Machine\" that dominates the stage (essentially a set of giant MDF cogs, but let's not puncture the metaphor), to the drum kit on wheels that is heaved towards centre stage in the closing moments. The overall aesthetic combines interwar industrial dystopianism - think Chaplin's Modern Times, or Fritz Lang's Metropolis - with bare-chested centurions who appear to have been drafted in from a Derek Jarman film. </p><p>And all this for a mispronounced ode to the male posterior - \"You are sexy bom; really crazy bom.\" You sense that someone on Svetlana's design team must be having the time of his life.</p><h2><a href=\"http://www.tinyurl.com/eurorussia\">Russia – the tactical no-hope one</a></h2><p>And so to the vexed question of \"political voting\", and the apparent refusal of eastern European countries to cast votes for their western counterparts. Until last year, the standard anti-conspiracy theory ran like this: political voting might bump a mediocre song up a couple of notches, but it has never created a winner. Besides, non-conspiracists would say: how exactly does one organise a conspiracy based on not voting for people? But at the 2008 finals, with former Soviet republics submitting nearly a quarter of all votes cast, most agreed that a tipping point had been reached. How else to explain the triumph of Russian-language superstar Dima Bilan, and his resolutely unmemorable song Believe?</p><p>Stung into action by a surging tide of western dissent, Terry Wogan fulminating at its helm, the authorities have tried to reassure those suspicious of the east by reintroducing a jury system that will count for half of each country's votes, with votes from TV viewers accounting for the other half (since 2002, TV viewers have controlled the whole vote). Theoretically, jurors are drawn from a select pool of music business experts, and charged with the solemn duty of evaluating each entry strictly on its songcraft - but if past practice is any measure, then any country deploying pan pipes, Gypsy fiddles or power ballads stands to be rewarded handsomely.</p><p>None of this need concern this year's Russian entry, as every effort has been taken to ensure that Moscow won't be playing host again in 2010. Anastasiya Prikhodko was parachuted into the selection process at the 11th hour, and whole sections of her song Mamo are caterwauled in Ukranian, in effect dampening local support to a containable minimum. Besides, every final needs its toilet break. It's a service, of sorts.</p><h2><a href=\"http://www.tinyurl.com/eurofrance\">France – the dignified, face-saving one</a></h2><p>For the so-called \"big four\" (France, Germany, Spain and the UK), whose annual financial contributions to Eurovision guarantee automatic passage to the finals (payola didn't die, it just became transparent), crunch time has come. Long since barred from the top half of the scoreboard, and presumably weary of forever bankrolling their own ritual humiliation, all four countries have raised their games - even the French, habitually impervious to being slighted by the rest of Europe. </p><p>Patricia Kaas is a multimillion-selling institution in her homeland, so there's nothing she needs to prove tomorrow night. Indeed, her gimmick is that there's no gimmick. Alone on a bare stage, she smoulders; she emotes; she delivers. Her song - no, her chanson - is John Barry with a twist of Jacques Brel; it's Charlotte Rampling sulking in a wet-look trenchcoat; it's a jaded nightclub turn at the end of the evening. It's a grower rather than an instant hit, to be sure - but it could be the \"growers\" that stand to gain most from the reintroduction of a jury system. Although for safety's sake, a last-minute burst of Gypsy fiddling possibly wouldn't go amiss.</p><h2><a href=\"http://www.tinyurl.com/eurouk\">United Kingdom – the ovation-inspiring one</a></h2><p>Dare we dream? OK, so the combination of Andrew Lloyd Webber and Diane Warren might have gifted us with little more than a glorified upgrade of the X Factor winner's template - as if the world was crying out for another That's My Goal, When You Believe or A Moment Like This, for pity's sake. But to dwell on It's My Time's generic standing-prouds, breaking-throughs and moah-ments risks missing a crucial point. Its whole raison d'&ecirc;tre is to grab votes, and if that calls for a syrupy show tune, then so be it. </p><p>Boosted by a superb place in tomorrow's draw (the 23rd song of 25, sandwiched between undistinguished offerings from Romania and Finland), \"our\" Jade Ewen has everything to play for. An unarguably accomplished vocalist, she sells It's My Time like a trouper, taking us on a three-minute journey from nervous hesitance to triumphant certainty. </p><p>In a night of a thousand key changes (don't even think of planning your Eurovision drinking game without factoring them in), Ewen gets to ride the most show-stopping, ovation-inducing key change of them all - just as the camera pans round to reveal Lord Lloyd Webber himself, modestly placed behind his piano, and doubtless flushing with demure pride at a job well done. </p><p>• The Eurovision Song Contest is on BBC1 tomorrow at 8pm.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/347360476|2014-05-04T12:09:17Z|f6fb02dad1e9f7023b9f45a46a554abffc5ec649 -->",

	"body" : "<p>Hotels are fruitful settings for fiction. Like theatres, they come with a built-in set of contrasts: front-of-house grandeur versus backstage seediness, institutional permanence versus transient personnel. They can act as reminders that none of us is a permanent resident on this earth, as in Ali Smith's Hotel World. Or they can stand in for larger living arrangements, as the Majestic Hotel in JG Farrell's Troubles comes to stand in for the Anglo-Irish ascendancy and the British empire in general. With their intricate hierarchies and overlapping jurisdictions, hotel staffs are an attractive prospect for a novelist too, offering all the advantages of a small, enclosed community with the bonus of a window on a wider world through the presence of paying guests.  </p><p>All this seems to have figured in Monica Ali's calculations when she planned her third novel, In the Kitchen.  The kitchen in question belongs to \"Jacques\", the restaurant of the Imperial Hotel, an endlessly refurbished edifice near London's Piccadilly Circus. Built by mutton-chopped Victorian businessmen, and now owned by a multinational corporation, the Imperial functions as a none too subtle reflection of the country's changing face. Interchangeable agency workers of doubtful immigration status do the menial work, while the kitchen - \"part prison, part lunatic asylum, part community hall\" - is staffed by a cross-section of the London labour market: a soft-spoken Liberian refugee, an inscrutable Russian &eacute;migr&eacute;, a self-improving Indian cook and so on. (For comic relief, there's also a melancholy pastry chef with a heavy French accent.) Gabriel Lightfoot, the executive chef, is one of the few English-born people in the place. \"If the Imperial were a person,\" he thinks, \"you would say here is someone who does not know who she is.\"</p><p>\"Gabe\", as he mostly calls himself, turns out to be having an identity crisis of his own, although it takes a long time to manifest itself. Aged 42, and worried about his bald spot, he has a number of projects in hand, all of which set him up as someone heading for a fall. Being head chef means spending more time on administration than cooking, and also involves him in endless fraught meetings with creepy management types. When not dealing with them, or trying to mediate between his squabbling underlings, he advances his secret plans for his own restaurant, which he's planning to open with the financial backing of an unpredictable businessman and a media-friendly MP. He also has vague plans to marry his girlfriend, a red-haired singer who's variously described as \"plump-skinned\" and \"lovely as a summer's day\". Finally, he means to spend more time with his father, a former industrial weaver who's now dying of colorectal cancer in Lancashire.</p><p>Ali tries to give Gabe's problems a dramatic shape by tying his growing sense of crisis to a death that takes place in the cellars beneath his kitchen. One day Yuri, a Ukranian porter he's barely noticed before, is found down there in a pool of blood. During the police investigation, Gabe locks eyes with a porter named Lena, a skinny young woman from Belarus who seems to know more about Yuri than she's saying. Implausibly abruptly (Ali gives him a fever to smooth out this difficult transition), Gabe has installed her in his flat, begun learning her story of human trafficking and abuse, and developed an unreciprocated sexual obsession. Here the reader starts expecting his world to unravel in tandem with his horrified investigation of the market mechanisms supplying him with workers. Before that happens, though, the novel piles up background and non-dramatic incident in a way that broadens its thematic range at the expense of narrative drive.  </p><p>In the Kitchen works best as a novel about work. Ali has done her homework on restaurant kitchens and weaving, and uses both as sustained metaphors for contrasting visions of society: the cohesive social fabric nostalgically remembered by Gabe's father and his peers, and the melting pot of Gabe's kitchen in the contemporary world of deregulated labour. Perhaps, the New Labour MP suggests, British identity has itself been marketised: \"We talk about the multicultural model but it's really nothing more than laissez-faire . . . Britishness is or has become essentially about a neutral, value-free identity.\" In this scheme of things, resentment of immigrants - which plays a part in Gabe's working-class Lancashire childhood as well as the exploitative employment practices documented elsewhere in the book - arises in part from envy of clear-cut cultural identities and the presumed social solidarity of immigrant communities. \"Fuck you,\" Gabe thinks at a veiled woman in the street, \"for having what I don't.\"  </p><p>Unfortunately, these sociological musings are only very cursorily dramatised, being plonked in the mouths of mostly one-note characters: the social Darwinian businessman, the cynically charming MP, the deterministic Russian, the man of working-class rectitude. The dialogue is often clumsily expository, and Ali has trouble mixing Gabe's thoughts with his actions, generally falling back on describing them in alternating paragraphs. But the main problem is the central character himself, who's wooden and oddly characterless in spite of his potentially attention-grabbing attributes, which include a troubled childhood, a propensity to mania and compensatory interest in high-precision French cooking. At no point does the reader believe that this static, passive figure has within himself the passions the plot requires of him. Combined with Ali's humdrum writing, he does fatal damage to a state-of-the-nation novel of commendable ambition - an interesting set of ideas deflated in the execution.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/346090066|2014-05-04T12:09:17Z|06e54acf94fef80e45f0f5f597c71981b46468ba -->",

	"body" : "<p>It's a crisp, sunny morning in Colorado Springs. We've decided to spend another day in this mile-high Rocky Mountain city, soaking up some of its renowned conservative Christian spirit while we await the arrival of Sarah Palin tomorrow morning. It being Sunday, some of us have decided to go to church - and not just any church. At 10:00 we head out toward the expansive \"campus\" of <a href=\"http://www.newlifechurch.org/\">New Life Church</a>, located on the outskirts of town a stone's throw away from the US Air Force Academy and beneath the looming presence of Pike's Peak. </p><p>As huge as it is, this isn't the largest evangelical mega-church in America, but it is probably the most famous and it certainly has been the most influential: Its founder and former pastor, Ted Haggard, headed the National Association of Evangelicals and reportedly had a <a href=\"http://www.therevealer.org/archives/timely_001945.php\">direct line </a>to the Bush White House—right up to the moment when he <a href=\"http://coloradoindependent.com/904/pastor-who\">was caught </a>buying meth and having sex with a male prostitute in 2006.  <br/> <br/>When we arrive at the enormous \"Worship Center,\" the lobbies are bedlam, as busy as Grand Central Station during any rush hour. Parents are lining up at check-in counters to drop off their kids for Sunday school sessions before rushing into a space that looks more like a high-tech concert hall than a church, with elaborate sound systems, TV cameras, screens scrolling Biblical texts, and a backdrop that changes from light blue to crimson to a simulacrum of a traditional church, stained glass and all. Two armed city cops stand guard at the door: Last December, a young man who had been bounced out of a missionary training program in Denver <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7140409.stm\">opened fire </a>at the end of a service here, killing two and wounding two others. </p><p>By 11:00 sharp the hall, which has a <a href=\"http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4191/is_/ai_n10043749\">capacity of 7,500</a>, looks packed. The New Life congregation alone numbers over 12,000. And this weekend Colorado Springs's other famous fundamentalist institution, James Dobson's <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/id/2109621/\">Focus on the Family</a>, is hosting a <a href=\"http://www.ndptf.org/summit/\">National Day of Prayer Summit</a>, timed to take place \"just days before our national and local elections\" because, its organizers say, \"As we look over our country, we see a land in need of the Savior, Jesus Christ,\" and they want the faithful to \"pray and intercede with fellow believers for this critical hour in which we live.\"  </p><p>People like myself, brought up to expect the solemnn silence that settles over mainline protestant churches as the parishioners file in and the service begins, were ill prepared for what we would experience here. The parade of people flowing in looks more like they are attending a football game: Young women with low-cut blouses, men in shorts, their bellies bursting out of tee shirts, a Vietnam vet in a motorcycle jacket with the word \"Sniper\" boldly etched on it. There are very few suits. There are even fewer non-white faces: I spot one black person, a couple of Asian Americans and Latinos. The crowd is loud and ebullient, filling the aisles with chatter. I hear one woman giving another advice about helping an injured rabbit. A third companion chimes in that the Parables can be a big help when dealing with animals.</p><p>Suddenly, all hell - so to speak - breaks loose. The lights dim, and the nine-piece Desperation Band lays down the Christian beat, singing, \"You are greater, greater than the fight that rages for my life.\" Standing on risers behind the rock band, a choir of some 70 people sways in unison. Most in the audience are on their feet, hands stretched upwards in the Pentecostal reach towards God. Many ecstatic parishioners begin to dance in place. They remain standing for a good half hour while the band bangs out one tune after another. Finally it stops, and they gratefully collapse into their chairs. A preacher appears and asks everyone to take their minds off their financial problems and apply a magnifying glass to God - and fork over some money to the church. Men with white plastic buckets make their way through the aisles. Some people put in change or bills, but a surprising number give nothing.</p><p>Another preacher appears and begins to talk about all the great things the church is doing, and how he himself has it on for the people of the Ukraine, a post-Communist country that, as he describes it, badly needs their help. He prays for the Ukranians for a while, then moves on to the natives of the Amazon rainforest, whom some of the congregants will soon be visiting on what sounds like a combination of missionary work and exotic vacation. We leave before the end of the service, and as we head off of the New Life grounds, we pass a group of men standing at the roadside, waving big Sarah Palin signs. They give us a fistful of tickets for Monday morning's rally. </p><p>Palin is sure to feel the love when she speaks to the crowd here in the city that has been described as the \"Evangelical Vatican.\" But she will be, literally, preaching to the converted. And it turns out even the conservative evangelicals aren't united behind the Republican Party the way they used to be: In a <a href=\"http://egan.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/08/my-own-private-focus-group/?partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=\"rss\"\">recent interview </a>the current New Life pastor, Brady Boyd, cited the financial crisis as \"point number one,\" and said: \"The only advice I give is pray, fast and vote, and that can be for any political party...What's happening to us is less allegiance to the Republican party, and more to our core principles.\" </p><p>Others on the Christian right <a href=\"http://www.rockymountainnews.com/news/2008/Sep/02/palin-no-stranger-focus-family/\">remain steadfast </a>to the GOP.  But the fact that the ticket is losing despite the addition of Sarah Palin clearly proves something: While conservative Christians may be a formidable force in American politics, they can't elect a president by themselves. The right-wing evangelicals joined a Republican coalition that also included libertarians, hawkish neocons, working-class \"Reagan Democrats,\" and old-fashioned fiscal conservatives. And some of these are now leaving the flock in favor of what Christopher Buckley, <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/politics/war_room/2008/10/10/buckley_bails/index.html?source=\"rss\"\">endorsing Obama</a>, called a \"first-class temperament and a first-class intellect.\" It's quite something to be judged too erratic or too stupid by people who once supported George W. Bush - but in some minds, McCain and Palin seem to have achieved that dubious distinction.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/338773896|2014-05-04T12:09:17Z|1447bc8b1c5818e5ef6dd96419aa13d2a242c547 -->",

	"body" : "<p>Russia only sent troops and tanks to drive Georgian forces out of South Ossetia after President George Bush failed to put pressure on Georgia's president to stop his attacks on the breakaway territory, Vladimir Putin said yesterday. The Russian prime minister told a group of western journalists and experts on Russia that he held two meetings with the US leader during the Beijing Olympics as the crisis began to unfold, but received insufficient assurances from him.</p><p>\"They [Georgian military forces] launched their attacks at 23:30 [on August 7]. I learned about it the following morning. I spoke to Bush. He said 'No one wants war.' We expected something would happen,\" Putin said, suggesting that he expected the US to rein in its regional ally in Tbilisi.</p><p>\"I met him again at the stadium. I can't tell you in detail the content of the conversation, but I had the feeling that his administration wouldn't do anything about stopping the conflict,\" Putin said. Russian tanks were then ordered to move on the South Ossetian capital, Tskhinvali.</p><p>It is the first time  that Putin has blamed the US for allowing the crisis to erupt. He was polite about Bush, saying he respected his integrity, but he suggested that the president's advisers had taken the key decisions. \"It's a court which makes a king. Maybe the court thought the king shouldn't intervene,\" he said.</p><p>In his trademark blunt language, Putin also issued a direct warning to the UK that relations could never be repaired as long as London hosted dissident exiles such as the Chechen independence advocate Akhmed Zakayev. \"Why do you allow Great Britain to be used as a launching pad to fight Russia? If we were to give safe haven to militants of the IRA, with arms in their hands, what would you do? Why can they engage in open anti-Russian activity? That's why it's not possible to build normal relations with Britain,\" he said. </p><p>Zakayev was given asylum in Britain in 2003, the same year as the Russian tycoon Boris Berezovsky. Both were close to the former KGB spy Alexander Litvinenko, whose murder in London in 2006 sent bilateral relations plunging.</p><p>Despite his tough language over the South Ossetia conflict, Putin refused to issue threats against the west for supporting Georgia. He accused the US of training the Georgian army before its attack on Tskhinvali last month. \"They sent instructors who helped to mobilise the Georgian forces. Of course we had to respond.\"</p><p>Throughout yesterday's three-hour meeting, he blamed the west for being stuck in cold war \"anti-Russian phobia\", and the American presidential candidates, John McCain and Barack Obama, for \"playing the Russian card\". This was \"only a sign of the candidates' weakness\", he said.</p><p>Making it clear that any expansion of Nato to Georgia or Ukraine would be unwelcome to Moscow, Putin said it was time to create a security architecture for Europe which reflected the new realities in the continent. </p><p>Russia had no imperial aims, he said, and should be credited for dismantling the Soviet Union. \"Had it not been for Russia, the Soviet Union wouldn't have been dismantled,\" he said.</p><p>He took issue with the Bush administration's recent decision to install long-range missiles in Poland, ostensibly as a defence against potential missiles from Iran. Iran had no such missiles, he said, and the US missile system's intentions were clear. If the US deployed any missiles, Russia would target Poland. \"Our targeting will start as soon as the missiles are deployed,\" Putin said. \"We say, please don't try again to instigate an arms race in Europe.\" </p><p>He criticised the Bush administration for foisting decisions on Europe. The missile decisions \"began with bilateral talks with Poland, and then they started to convince Europe it was in their interest\". He made the same point about Ukraine's government's decision to seek Nato membership. \"Eighty per cent of Ukranians don't want it,\" he said. </p><p>He denied that he was in overall control of Russian decision-making, insisting that President Dmitry Medvedev was the commander in chief. \"He's modern, with a liberal democratic view of things and an excellent education. I am sorry it was his lot to have to deal with this crisis. He is a decent man. He had to give the order to send troops to these republics [South Ossetia and the other breakaway region of Abkhazia]. He had to recognise these republics, he couldn't do otherwise. These were his decisions.\" </p><p>Putin made clear that Russia could easily have occupied Georgia and toppled its president, Mikheil Saakashvili. \"Our forces were 15 kilometres [nine miles] from Tbilisi. It would have taken four hours to capture Tbilisi. We didn't have that goal.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/337530211|2014-05-04T12:09:17Z|6ae81f557121bf235cb6def5800eafb1250305b6 -->",

	"body" : "'You have been very badly brought up,' an infuriated Jacques Chirac shouted at Tony Blair during one confrontation at a European summit. This is far from the only moment of combustion between the Prime Minister and the President of France. It was Blair who was enraged by Chirac when the President told the Prime Minister that he would not be able to look Leo in the face when his son became old enough to understand the war in Iraq. <P>So it will be one of the more piquant ironies of their tempestuous relationship if the unpopularity of the mercurial French President in his twilight years at the Elys&#233;e Palace extends the life of Tony Blair at Number 10. France votes on the European constitution next Sunday. Should that vote be a non, gales of relief will gust through Downing Street. Ministers have been emitting mixed signals in public about would happen next, but their private assumption is that a victory for the French nonistes will kill the constitution stone dead. Tony Blair will be released from his promise to hold a referendum in Britain next year, removing the threat that this could hasten him into involuntary retirement.  <P>The rejection of the constitution by the French, the dynamos of European integration for so many decades, would be a sensation. If ministers have been making confusing noises about the consequences, it is because they are genuinely uncertain about what the consequences would be. A time bomb under Tony Blair might be defused only to be replaced by a mine field. With Britain in the chair of the European Union in the second half of this year, it would fall to the Prime Minister to handle the mother of all crises in European politics. The challenge would be complicated by the rising antagonism elsewhere in Europe to the British financial rebate. Mr Blair might relish being cast into the statesmanly role of trying to guide Europe out of the chaos. But so much for the idea that he would devote his remaining time as Prime Minister to burnishing his domestic legacy.  <P>A non by the French would be much more than a non to the text of the constitution. It would be a howl of angst and anger about the entire direction of the EU and the place of France in it and the wider world. The rejectionists range from trade unionists, greens and socialists via feminists and Gaullists to the far right racists of the National Front. The impulses driving this opposition are no less powerful for being so disparate. The constitution is portrayed as a devilish Blairiste plot to further diminish French ideas and influence, already diluted by the EU's enlargement. There is fear of losing jobs to eastern Europe and France being inundated by eastern European job-hunters. Added to that is hostility to the prospect of Turkey joining the Union. Voting against the constitution allows a French voter to simultaneously rage against a declining President, a struggling economy, immigration, Americanisation and the forces of globalisation.  <P>Three days later, Holland votes in its referendum and the chances of the Dutch saying no are higher still. Since the constitution needs ratification by all 25 members of the EU to become legal, a Dutch nee would send shockwaves through Europe almost as profound as a French non. Like the French, the Dutch were founding fathers of the EEC. Even more so than the French, they have been enthusiasts for ever closer European union. So a Dutch rejection of the constitution could be regarded as an even more sensational rupture. The Dutch chafe against having to make a larger net contribution to the EU than anyone else. They don't like the inflation that has accompanied the euro, nor the way in which France and Germany have bent the rules on budget deficits in the euro zone. In an echo of British euroscepticism, the Dutch worry about being subsumed into a superstate. In common with some of the French nonistes, hostility to immigration will drive many of the Dutch who vote no.  <P>In France and Holland alike, the rejectionists have tapped into deep and visceral wells of distrust in the political establishment, a pattern which will be repeated here if Britain does end up having its own referendum. All the main political parties in Holland are campaigning in favour of the constitution, as are the Dutch equivalents of the CBI and TUC and virtually all of the newspapers. Likewise in France, the establishment is urging voters to say  oui, and the government has spent hundreds of millions of euros promoting the cause.  <P>Thrown into a panic by the success of the no campaign, leaders from elsewhere in Europe have rushed to France to impress upon its voters their 'responsibility' to follow the establishment's advice. Frightened by the threat that both the French and the Dutch might reject the treaty, Europe's leaders have tried to scare the voters back. That seems to have been little help to the yes campaign. In fact, it has probably been of greater assistance to their opponents. European leaders wielding dire threats to bluster and bully people into voting yes only serves to foment the accusation that Europe is a conspiracy of the elite against the people. It is a French conspiracy to British sceptics; it is a Britannique conspiracy to French antis. That this is contradictory does not make it any less potent.  <P>Val&#233;ry Giscard d'Estaing, the treaty's architect, says it is 'impossible' to improve on his design. Gerhard Schr&#246;der, the German Chancellor, has told French voters that it is a 'pure illusion' to believe that there is a 'Plan B'. This simply adds to the impression of a European governing class telling its citizens that they must take what they are given from above.  <P>The product that they are trying to sell does not help. Hilarious as it may sound now, the original notion was that an EU constitution would help address 'the democratic deficit' between Europe's institutions and its citizens. The exercise was supposed to bring the EU closer to its peoples and make them more empathetic to a rejuvenated Union. The mammoth text - read by few, penetrated by less - has monumentally failed in that, its most important challenge.  <P>A case can be made that it will make decision-making more efficient and enable Europe to become a more effective player on the global stage. The trouble is that those are arguments made by bureaucrats and politicians to appeal to bureaucrats and politicians. This presents the constitution as something manufactured by and for the political establishment in an anti-establishment, anti-political age.   <P>What hasn't been mustered by Europe's leadership is any case for the constitution because it will improve or enrich the lives of their peoples. French and Dutch politicians have proved to be incapable of articulating why voting yes would be of advantage to the average citizen. When I ask politicians in London how they would sell practical benefits from the constitution to the typical British voter, they almost invariably sigh and change the subject.  <P>The EU can claim to be an outstanding success. It has spread peace and prosperity in a continent which was a charnel house of dictatorship, death and destruction. It is the best advertisement for the virtues of 'soft power' the world has ever seen. Romanians, Turks and Ukranians clamour to be part of it. This makes the EU a club which is more popular with those who want to join it than with those who are already members.  <P>Even if the French and the Dutch narrowly vote yes and spare the EU from an immediate convulsion, they will have given a deserved fright to Europe's leaders. If one or both countries vote no, the shock will be salutary.  <P>The EU has been drained of legitimacy in the eyes of far too many of its citizens. Europe's leaders have been arrogant in assuming support, then complacent about addressing the absence of it and are now in a blind panic about what to do about it. What a rich irony if it falls to Tony Blair, leader of the most sceptic nation of the lot, to pick up the pieces of Europe's crisis of faith.<!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/5199182|2014-05-04T12:09:17Z|2df9d31da256d7fb4f2f30c2092412a6de76c08b -->",

	"body" : "<p>On June 2 1979 one of cinema's greatest female directors was killed in a car crash outside Leningrad. She was 39. Her name was Larisa Shepitko, and, even if you're a film buff, the chances are you've never heard of her. Barely any of Shepitko's mesmerising films have been screened in Britain. None is available on DVD. In fact they're scarcely shown, or known, in Russia. Yet, at the time of her sudden death, Shepitko was hot property on the international film circuit: she was young for a film-maker; she was strikingly attractive; her exquisite masterpiece The Ascent had won the prestigious Golden Bear at the 1977 Berlin festival. She had all the live-fast-die-young glamour that would ensure instant icon status for far inferior artists. </p><p>So why has Shepitko's work remain buried for so long? For the answer, look no further than Lenin's declaration that \"film for us, is the most important art\". Shepitko did not find it easy to satisfy communism's cultural commissars.  </p><p>Born in Ukraine in 1938, Shepitko was one of three children raised by her schoolteacher mother. Her father, a Persian officer, had abandoned his family through early divorce - an act that Larisa never forgave. When she enrolled in the Moscow film academy in 1955, her dramatic eyes and dark, cheekboned elegance attracted much attention. However, her sole focus was film-making, and in 1958 she studied direction at the State Institute for Cinematography (VGIK), a few years behind Andrei Tarkovsky. Her tutor was Alexander Dovzhenko, a towering figure of early Soviet cinema and contemporary of Eisenstein. His poetical imagery and passionate celebration of Ukranian folk culture were a marked influence on the young Shepitko, who called him \"my mentor\" and took to heart his motto: \"You have to approach each film as if it were your last.\"  </p><p>Shepitko's graduation film, Heat (1963), was an extraordinary first undertaking. A daring fusion of political drama and Western-style showdown between an idealistic high-school youth and a Stalinist farm leader, it was shot on the barren steppes in such extreme climate conditions that Shepitko fell dangerously ill. Stretchered off set, she called in another young film-maker to help complete the project; this was her fellow VGIK student Elem Klimov, whose war film Come and See (1985) Stephen Spielberg would later cite as an influence on Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan.  </p><p>Elem (named from the first letters of Engels, Lenin, Marx) had previously proposed marriage to Shepitko, but, like all the others, been rejected. Now he was accepted - but only after he vowed he wouldn't try to influence Shepitko's work.  </p><p>United by intelligence, introspection and a certain dash, the Klimovs, along with Tarkovsky, were at the forefront of the Russian \"New Wave\" that flourished under Khrushchev before the cultural clampdown of 1967-8. In 1966 Shepitko was able to create her controversial second feature, Wings, which drew a stellar   performance from Maya Bulgakova as a once-famous Stalinist fighter pilot now a disenchanted provincial schoolteacher.  </p><p>An ill-fated omnibus called Beginning of an Unknown Era was Shepitko's first real loss to censorship. Commissioned to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the October Revolution, its unsentimental depiction of the early days of communism was hardly the banner-waving Bolshevik propaganda the Party had hoped for - particularly Angel, the segment directed by Andrei Smirnov, where a worker menaced by an officer with a gun comments: \"How simple it is to kill and to condemn in the name of the revolution.\" The film was not shown until 1987.  </p><p>The banning of Beginning depressed Shepitko. However, her primary concern as an artist was not political protest, but the more intimate exploration of the individual in society, struggling with that eternal question: \"Why do we live?\"  </p><p>You and Me (1971), set in contemporary Russia, is her most experimental feature, and her only one in Technicolor. This is an existentialist narrative about two male surgeons in crisis about their ideals, balancing individual despair with hope in a wider humanity and responsibility. \"I   always used to think it was all or nothing,\" Dr Pyotr says to a suicidal girl, \"But there's always somebody who needs you.\"  </p><p>Now 35, Larisa took time off from work to have a child. It was a life-changing moment. As she said in her final interview in June 1979, \"I saw death very closely. I had a serious spine injury, and at the time I was expecting a child. I could have died, because I decided to keep the child. At that time I was facing death for the first time, and like anyone in such a situation I was looking for my own formula of immortality.\"  </p><p>The result was her numinous masterpiece The Ascent (1976). Drawn from Vasily Bykov's novella Sotnikov, it's the tense tale of two starving partisans crawling across the hostile snows of Belarus during the 1942 Nazi occupation. The film is outstanding not just for its ravishing aestheticism, but its Dostoevksian soul-wrestling and gripping central performances. The final scenes, where the Christ-like hero Sotnikov (Boris Plotnikov) dies because of his own stubborn convictions, form one of the most hypnotically powerful moments of 1970s cinema.  </p><p>Despite The Ascent's success - international as well as national, although the Soviet authorities banned export of other masterpieces such as Tarkovsky's Andrei Rublev - Larisa was increasingly preoccupied by death. Highly superstitious, she had her fortune told in Bulgaria in 1978, after which she immediately took her friend to a nearby church and made her swear that, should anything happen to her or Elem, she must look after their young son, Anton. A few months later, she was killed.  </p><p>It was so abrupt; the Soviet film community was stunned into numbness. Tarkovsky wrote in his diary: \"Larisa Shepitko was buried, and so were five members of her team. A car accident. All killed instantly. It was so sudden that no adrenaline was found in their blood.\"  </p><p>Shepitko had been on location for a new film, The Farewell. Just a week after the accident, her husband was on set to complete it. The film, in which a traditional Siberian peasant village is condemned in order to facilitate the march of progress, is another implicit critique of modern communism. Interesting though it is (it was allegedly a favourite of Gorbachev's), Klimov's Farewell lacks the perfect pitch of the best of Shepitko's work.  </p><p>Today, 25 years after Shepitko's death, her films have finally reached Britain. Leeds International Film festival, working with Soviet Export Film, has organised a retrospective of her entire oeuvre, from her four finished features to her prize-winning shorts (plus The Farewell and a tribute from Elem Klimov). All, particularly the last features, deserve an audience not as dated curiosities from another era, but because Shepitko's mysticism is rooted in an ever-relevant sense of humanity. It's time this long-lost Soviet visionary was brought in from the cold.</p><p><strong>&#183;</strong> The Larisa Shepitko retrospective is at the ICA, London SW1 (020-7930 3647), until January 27, and at venues throughout Britain during January</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/5099346|2014-05-04T12:09:17Z|0b45743170d6f9db5b59e85c62a237c0b47918e2 -->",

	"body" : "<p><strong>January</strong><br />   The New Year began familiarly, with a taped message from Osama Bin Laden and bad news from Iraq, which would continue to dominate the year. Two US helicopters were brought down in the increasingly familiar Falluja, and British troops exchanged fire with insurgents in Amarah; this was accompanied by bomb explosions in Baghdad and numerous dead Iraqis - officially unaccounted for, as usual. </p><p>Nor was there much respite to the north, where an earthquake killed some 30,000 people and made another 100,000 homeless in and around the Iranian city of Bam. Ironists and existentialists joined in the rejoicing when a 97-year-old woman was found alive after surviving eight days under the rubble. Her first request was for a cup of tea. Out of this world, there was not so much as a yelp after Beagle 2 landed on Mars.  </p><p>Tony Blair suggested that proper consideration should be given to the \"totality\" of his remarks about whether or not he had authorised the leaking of the name of Dr David Kelly, the government scientist and popular media source on Iraq and weapons of mass destruction. Lord Hutton's report of the totality surrounding Dr Kelly's subsequent suicide confounded many of his lordship's admirers by contriving to blame everyone but Mr Blair and his government, which also survived a Commons vote on its plans to charge university students top-up fees. The governor and the director-general of the BBC resigned. Harold Shipman, the Manchester GP who had murdered at least 200 patients, was found hanged in his prison cell. David Blunkett, the Home Secretary, confided that on hearing the news he had wondered if it was too early to \"open a bottle\".  </p><p>Britney Spears got married. The Barclay twins agreed to buy Lord Black's newspapers, which include the Daily and Sunday Telegraph; much of the rest of the year was taken up with negotiations, legal manoeuvrings and insights into the Black way of life, including his wife's habit of charging tips to the company and her ownership of 100 pairs of Manolo Blahnik shoes and 12 Herm&#232;s Birkin handbags, for which there is a waiting list of two and a half years. \"Since when was greed a criminal offence?\" asked Lord Black. An HB handbag was also the chosen arm accessory of Martha Stewart, the upper-middle-American style maven, for her court appearance on fraud charges. One of only 30 Norwegian robins known to have visited Britain since 1919 was eaten by a cat in a London garden. Stone slabs thought to be evidence of the first Viking settlements in Britain turned out to be the remains of a 1939 patio. Britney Spears got unmarried.  </p><p><strong>February</strong><br />   A 63-year-old retired businessman and former French foreign legionnaire from Frome became the oldest man to walk to the South Pole. \"I don't give a damn if I never see another fucking snowflake again in my life,\" he said. Armin Meiwes was found guilty of manslaughter rather than murder after a German court found that his victim had consented to being eaten. At least 21 Chinese cockle pickers drowned after being trapped by Morecambe Bay's capricious tides.  </p><p>Mel Gibson's film in Aramaic about Christ's Passion aroused much in others. The Russian Orthodox Church ruled that chess was not the work of the devil. Pigeons were revealed to be using roads to navigate: \"Every Saturday you can see flocks of pigeons flying up the M5,\" said one fancier.  </p><p>Jonathan Aitken declared himself moved, amazed, humbled and hoped he did not seem absurdly immodest in recognising the merits of a petition by 200 party activists urging him to put himself forward as a prospective candidate for his old constituency. After the blood had drained back, Michael Howard declared him a non-runner. A Tokyo undertaker beat his aunt to death with a golf club because he needed the business. Scientists in South Korea were acknowledged to have successfully cloned human embryos. Thousands wept as Microsoft ran into trouble with its new software and the MyDoom virus.  </p><p><strong>March</strong><br />   Demonstrations in more than 300 cities marked the first anniversary of the Iraq war. Ten bombs exploded within 15 minutes in four commuter trains in Madrid, killing 201 people and injuring 1,647. A quarter of Spain's population took to the streets to demonstrate against the outrage. Three days later, the country's socialist party defeated the conservative government of Jose Maria Aznar and announced as its first act the withdrawal of its troops from Iraq. Suicide bombers mounted a co-ordinated attack on Shia mosques in Baghdad and Karbala, killing more than 140 people and injuring more than 400. This latest attempt to detonate Iraq's divisions was blamed, like much else, including the Madrid bombs, on the Jordanian militant, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, whose infamy status would over the year come almost to match that of Bin Laden, his ally or rival, depending on the source.  </p><p>A Hamas suicide bombing left 10 dead in Ashdod. Israeli air strikes killed Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, the Hamas spiritual leader, and Abdel-Aziz al-Rantissi, the Hamas leader in Gaza. Tony Blair shook hands with Colonel Gadafy in a tent south of Tripoli.  </p><p>Clare Short claimed that Britain had bugged Kofi Annan, the UN secretary-general, in the run-up to the war in Iraq. The Cabinet Secretary said he was \"extremely disappointed\" with her. The Sun sent a reporter dressed as a bug to follow her. \"What a ridiculous way to earn a living,\" said Ms Short. \"You could always do something else,\" said the Sun reporter. It wasn't long before she was.  </p><p>President Jean-Bertrand Aristide of Haiti flew to the Central African Republic after a revolt and pressure from the United States and France. There were two additions to the Blair myth: Cherie Booth revealed that her husband had once spent a night on a park bench, and Carole Caplin's nickname for him was said to be \"Toblerone\".  </p><p>New Britons from Afghanistan, Kenya, Poland and elsewhere took part in the country's first citizenship ceremony at Brent Town Hall, watched by the Prince of Wales, while a brass band played the theme from Four Weddings And A Funeral. The editor of Prospect magazine argued against too much cultural diversity. A molecular biologist revealed he had given it up for a better paid job as a plumber. Coca-Cola conceded that Dasani, its new bottled water, came out of taps in Sidcup. John F Kerry confirmed his position as Democrat challenger to George W Bush in the Super Tuesday primaries. One of only 12 American robins known to have visited this country was eaten by a sparrowhawk in Grimsby soon after landing.  </p><p>Lord Falconer found himself appointed Lord Chancellor after he tried to persuade the Lords to abolish the post of Lord Chancellor. In an interview with Gary Younge, Jayson Blair, former New York Times journalist, blamed his lying and inaccuracies on drink and cocaine. Five of the nine Britons held at Guant&#225;namo Bay for two years after their arrest in Afghanistan returned to Britain without charge. Germany was reported to be overrun with racoons descended from a pair introduced by Herman Goering. A brain surgeon was accused by the NHS of helping himself to an extra bowl of soup in the hospital cafeteria, and suspended.  </p><p><strong>April</strong><br />   Numbers of one-legged Romanian roofers and fingerless Bulgarian electricians were said to be at large in the country as a result of a relaxed Home Office policy towards vetting visa applications from foreign workers eager to service Britain's overheated economy. Someone had to leave: it was Beverley Hughes, immigration minister.  </p><p>Michael Grade was appointed BBC chairman. England's cricketers won a test series again the West Indies. England's rugby union players lost to Ireland. Tony Blair played quoits in Bermuda on one of his freebies. Germany won the world marbles championships in Sussex.  </p><p>Tony Blair finished the quoits, checked in at the White House and returned to Britain in time to read an open letter from 52 former British diplomats condemning the \"illegal and brutal occupation\" of Iraq and his support for Ariel Sharon's \"one-sided and illegal\" policy of retaining West Bank settlements. Despite not having a reverse gear, he then announced that there would be a referendum on the new European constitution after all, confiding that \"I'm going to have to eat shit for a few days\", which seemed a little optimistic. Ron Atkinson was doing some of the same after airing some ill-favoured views on racial characteristics.  </p><p>A PA with Goldman Sachs was found guilty of stealing &#163;4.3m from her employers, who hadn't noticed. There were reports of massacres in Darfur. Altogether, it was revealed, Britons take 8m days off a year to get over the death of pets.  </p><p><strong>May</strong><br />   Europe welcomed 10 new members to its Union, including the Greek bit of the disunion of Cyprus. Picture followed picture of Iraqi prisoners in Abu Ghraib prison in Baghdad being humiliated by American guards employing electrodes, hoods, dogs and anything else that took their fancy. An American contractor became the first in a series of beheadings on video carried out by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, who said he was avenging the \"satanic degradation\" at Abu Ghraib. George Bush said Donald Rumsfeld, the US Defence Secretary, was doing \"a superb job\". British indignation at Abu Ghraib was tempered by 30 cases of alleged brutality by its forces. Piers Morgan, editor of the Daily Mirror, was sacked after publishing faked photographs purporting to show British soldiers mistreating Iraqis.  </p><p>It was seven years since Tony Blair became prime minister, 10 years since John Smith died, and 25 years since Margaret Thatcher became prime minister. Gordon Brown and John Prescott spent 90 minutes admiring the view from the car park of the Loch Fyne Oyster Bar and definitely not discussing shifting tectonic plates or their leader's faltering grip. Robert Mugabe called Tony Blair \"an anachronism\"; Fathers 4 Justice threw purple flour-filled condoms at him in the Commons. Celebrations of the 50th anniversary of Roger Bannister's four-minute   mile ran into rival claims: a costermonger called Parrot was said to have done it in Shoreditch High Street in 1770, also in May, and Mr Ken Wood of Sheffield said he'd done it on a training run 29 days before Sir Roger, but \"didn't regard it as all that important\" at the time. John Scarlett, the spy whose dossier more than slightly exaggerated the case for war against Iraq, was appointed head of MI6. Opinion was divided on whether he was stupid or a stooge. No one seemed to be asking whether he might be, perhaps, a double-stooge. The object of similar doubts, Maxine Carr, was released from prison.  </p><p>Sonia Gandhi renounced her claim to be prime minister of India, despite the victory by her Congress party in the general election there. St Helens crushed Wigan to win the Powergen Challenge Cup Final. Arsenal won the Premiership without losing a game. Le Figaro celebrated the centenary of the Entente Cordiale by arguing that the clarity and unambiguity of French made it superior to English, which seemed quite unfair. A school in Mansfield arranged an abortion for a 14-year-old pupil without consulting her parents. The Pope canonised a woman who sacrificed her life so that her child might be born.   </p><p>Oil and house prices continued to rise while pensions declined. The worth of that old maxim \"Never hold a wedding party if there are American forces within 100 miles\" was proved once again when more than 40 guests were killed by helicopter fire near the Syrian border. George Bush disproved the one about never forgetting how to ride a bicycle and grazed his nose. Figures showed that the average Briton is caught on CCTV camera 300 times a day. Big Brother started again. A new show on UKTV Style featured paint drying.  </p><p><strong>June</strong><br />   The UK Independence Party, bolstered by the cosmetic support of Robert Kilroy-Silk and Joan Collins, achieved 7% fewer votes than Labour and 1% more than the Lib Dems in the European elections. An average of more than one car bomb a day was exploding in Iraq. Poland recruited American Navajo scouts to track illegal immigrants from Ukraine. The Momart warehouse in London, storing works by Hirst, Emin, Heron and the Chapman brothers, went up in flames to predictably divided opinion. The England soccer team retired from Euro 2004, hurt by a dodgy pitch, a dodgy ref, Wayne Rooney's dodgy metatarsal and dodgy players. Jonny Wilkinson revealed that England rugby union players use moisturiser. Frank Lampard's armpits, meanwhile, were revealed to be waxed.  </p><p>The former American president Ronald Reagan died and was discovered to have saved the Free World. The crisis in Darfur was rediscovered, again. Sovereignty was restored to Iraq under the prime-ministership of Iyad Allawi, a long-exiled former Ba'athist. He had provided the exaggerated intelligence supporting invasion that hadn't been contributed by the disgraced Ahmad Chalabi, now accused of working for Iran. Saddam Hussein was formally handed over by the Americans, although they continued to guard him. Philip Green, of BHS and much else besides, battled to take over Marks &amp; Spencer. Big Brother went on.  </p><p><strong>July</strong><br />   Saddam Hussein appeared, grey-bearded and crisply shirted, in court in Baghdad to answer charges for crimes against the peoples of Iraq and Kuwait. He said he had invaded Kuwait because the Kuwaitis were trying to turn Iraqi women into prostitutes. Lord Butler found serious flaws in the quality, assessment and application of the intelligence that led to the war in Iraq and criticised the working practices of Downing Street and the Joint Intelligence Committee, but, being a highly experienced former civil servant, blamed it on incompetence rather than intention. Tony Blair blamed the 60s.  </p><p>John Kerry chose Senator John Edwards of North Carolina, who also had great hair, as his running mate. Michael Howard chose (Everything I Do) I Do It For You and All You Need Is Love on Desert Island Discs. A 100-year-old man ran 100 metres in 28.7 seconds in Cape Town. Israel's security fence was ruled illegal by the International Court of Justice and condemned by the United Nations. Laughing children played in the Diana Memorial Fountain in Hyde Park after it had been officially opened by the Queen.  </p><p>Charles Clarke, the education secretary, outlined some education reforms exhibiting a particularly bravura new Labour retro-futuro choice-mix involving public-private schools, faith schools, specialist schools, uniform, and public school houses. Harry Potter seemed to be the target pupil. The Commission for Racial Equality discovered that it was least likely to promote black employees. Laughing children stopped playing in the Diana Memorial Fountain after it flooded.  </p><p>Dame Shirley Porter, who claimed she had only &#163;300,000 to put towards to the &#163;42m she had been ordered to pay in compensation for gerrymandering wodges of Westminster, somehow scraped together &#163;12.3m, which was accepted.  </p><p>Eric Williams, 60, blacked out and crashed his car into Gordon White's living room in Cleckheaton, West Yorkshire, a year after he had done it the first time. Peter Mandelson returned to public life, the scene of several previous accidents. The Football Association's Soho HQ appeared to have taken key aspects of local industry enthusiastically on board. Philip Green withdrew his offer for Marks &amp; Spencer, making some robust suggestions about what should be done with the chairman's head. Martha Stewart was sentenced to five months and compared herself to Nelson Mandela. A grandmother in San Francisco foiled a burglary by showing the intruder pictures of her family until he fell asleep on the sofa. Darfur continued. Tony Blair stayed at Sir Cliff's villa in Barbados, despite his views on the 60s.  </p><p><strong>August</strong><br />   Three weeks of heavy fighting in Najaf between US forces and the Mahdi army of the radical Shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr were ended by the return of Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani to the holy city after medical treatment in London. Some said this set a hopeful precedent for other cities and flashpoints. More doubted it. Notting Hill continued its headlong descent into respectability by lending its name to a group of ambitious young Tories. Hurricane Charley devastated Florida. A flash flood devastated Boscastle. John Prescott rescued a canoeist. Google floated. The Princess Diana Memorial was reopened but laughing children were no longer allowed in it, although they could dangle their feet from the sides.  </p><p>Sheep in Yorkshire were reported to be rolling across cattle grids, just as they are every summer on a slack news day. Coal from Russia was carried to Newcastle. The Olympics returned to Athens. There was an alleged accident involving a motorcycle bearing Greeks who seemed less than keen on drugs tests. Britain became the first western country to permit therapeutic cloning. Tony Blair's Summer Holiday moved on from Sir Cliff's place to that of another famous crooner, Silvio Berlusconi. The usual complaints about dumbing down greeted the A-level results. George W Bush, on the campaign trial, tried to eat raw corn. A popular T-shirt at the Democratic convention sported the legend, \"One of Texas's villages is missing its idiot.\" Mark Thatcher, also famous for being missing, and for having no A-levels, was arrested on suspicion of financing an attempted coup in Equatorial Guinea, something he denied, although it wasn't clear if his defence was that he didn't know where it was. Michael Owen found his way to Real Madrid. Paula Radcliffe lost hers in Athens, but Kelly Holmes won, Amir Khan came second, Matthew Pinsent wept, and Big Brother finished. Uproar and amazement greeted a blind man having sex with an American.  </p><p><strong>September</strong><br /> \nTerrorists, assumed to be Chechen separatists, killed 331 people, 172 of them children, after seizing a school in Beslan, North Ossetia. One in five Germans wanted the Berlin wall rebuilt. Serbia banned the teaching of Darwinism in schools for the rest of the year. Charles Clarke proposed that schools should be open from 8am to 9pm, including the holidays, to provide child care for working parents. It was unclear whether this influenced Alan Milburn's decision to spend more time with his prime minister. Britney Spears got married.  </p><p>A figure in a Batman outfit carrying a large ladder failed to arouse the suspicions of the guards at Buckingham Palace. Kofi Annan said the invasion of Iraq had been illegal. Britain's ambassador in Rome was said to have described George Bush as \"the best recruiting sergeant ever for al-Qaida\". Tony Blair went to Brighton and apologised for having misled himself over the intelligence. He also spoke of \"a problem of trust\" and said Gordon Brown was \"a personal friend\". Melvyn Bragg, another personal friend, revealed that the prime minister had been close to quitting earlier in the year due to family pressures. Iyad Allawi went to Washington and told congress that he and they were succeeding in Iraq. Attacks by insurgents were averaging 70 a day. A British engineer, Kenneth Bigley, and two American colleagues fell into the hands of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. The two Americans were beheaded shortly afterwards.  </p><p>Here, they were bothered about foxes again; five pro-hunting protesters, including Bryan Ferry's son, invaded the floor of the Commons and were apprehended after a vigorous struggle with the gentlemen-at-arms, henceforth and delightfully known as the Men in Tights. Hurricane Ivan blew through Jamaica, Grenada and the southern states of the US, while Jeanne ravaged Haiti. Jack Straw stopped wearing spectacles and shook hands with Robert Mugabe. The United States accused the Sudanese government of genocide. Laughing children were stood down again as the Princess Diana Memorial Fountain closed again. There were the usual stories about conkers being dangerous.  </p><p><strong>October</strong><br /> \nTony Blair had a heart operation after saying he didn't want to serve a fourth term, and bought a house without a garden for &#163;3.6m. His wife earned &#163;30,000 for a 40-minute speech to insurance brokers in West Virginia. Labour just won the Hartlepool by-election caused by Peter Mandelson's move to Brussels. Michael Howard's Conservatives were forced into fourth place by Ukip. John Howard's Liberals were re-elected in Australia, even though or because he and his government had been described by the leader of the opposition as \"a conga line of suckholes\".  </p><p>Bob Geldof spoke up for marriage. A rich American joined rich Irishmen in wanting to run Manchester United. Kenneth Bigley was beheaded. Commentators were disturbed by the \"frenzy\" and \"indulgence\" of the reaction in Britain, particularly in the dead man's home city, Liverpool, whose inhabitants were accused by the Spectator of possessing a deeply unattractive psyche and contributing to the Hillsborough disaster through drunken behaviour. The magazine's editor, also a Tory spokesman on the arts, was ordered by Michael Howard, a keen supporter of the Liverpool team, to go to the city and apologise. He complied, but it did not go well, and subsequently went worse when a robust but economical reaction to reports about his private life led Michael Howard to sack him.  </p><p>Margaret Hassan, a British aid worker married to an Iraqi who had lived in Iraq for 30 years, was kidnapped. Labour's plans to deregulate gambling and allow large Las Vegas-style casinos, which had been bumbling along since at least 2001, suddenly, in the way of these things, caused an outbreak of apoplexy, principally from the Daily Mail. The first man was discovered to have been Asian. There were said to be only about 800 women called Maude left in the country.  </p><p>Tony Blair announced that one of the last duties of the Black Watch before it fell victim to defence cuts would be to support the uncomplicated approach of the US to the insurgency in Falluja. Some thought this dangerous but highly symbolic demonstration of support would help George Bush win the imminent American election, which, following the candidates' debates, was said to be very, very close. Paul Gascoigne announced that he was now to be known as G8. Rumours that Chelsea Clinton would now be known as SW3 proved unfounded.  </p><p>Arsenal lost their unbeaten record at Old Trafford and introduced a new phrase following an incident involving Sir Alex Ferguson and some pea broth: \"And then the soup really hit the manager.\" Parents everywhere were impressed when Prince Harry claimed to have done some of his A-level coursework. Tony Blair was said to be considering converting to Catholicism. And you thought the top job he was after in Europe was the federal presidency? A man in Beccles developed a jet-propelled shopping trolley. An ICM survey disclosed that one in 10 people in Britain thinks the Battle of Trafalgar was fought in Trafalgar Square. Kylie Minogue beat Salman Rushdie at Scrabble.  </p><p><strong>November</strong><br /> \nJohn Kerry got 55% of the vote, with George Bush trailing in with a sorry 5%. Unfortunately, this was the result of a worldwide internet poll. In the real event, George did rather better, thanks or no thanks to a valiant effort by Guardian readers to swing it by launching letters at Clark County, Ohio. London published its detailed bid for the 2012 Olympics. Athens's debt after the Olympics stood at &euro;7bn, &euro;1,900 for each Greek household.  </p><p>Despite pleas from every quarter, including that of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, Margaret Hassan was murdered by her kidnappers. There was more attention devoted to fox hunting. The bill to ban it was forced through after the government invoked the Parliament Act, a statute of dubious legality designed to resolve constitutional crises. The Queen entertained President Chirac at Windsor in the Music Room, known when President Chirac is not there as the Waterloo Room. England's cricketers visited Zimbabwe. Fortunately, Robert Mugabe decided against playing.  </p><p>The Prince of Wales was revealed to believe in a meritocracy that knows its place. Rocco Buttiglione's belief that homosexuality is a sin raised questions of tolerance that were not entirely answered by the refusal of MEPs to countenance his appointment as a EU commissioner. A plague of locusts reached southern Europe from northern Africa. Theo van Gogh was shot and stabbed to death in Amsterdam by a Muslim man after making a film alleging sexual and physical abuse of Muslim women. Twenty-four soccer teams comprised entirely of people called Patel played a tournament for charity in Leeds. Yasser Arafat died and was buried in Ramallah. To this date, nearly 3,500 Palestinians and 1,000 Israelis had been killed since September, 2000. Nearly 1,500 members of the coalition forces had died since the invasion of Iraq, and still no proper count, but somewhere between 10,000 and 100,000 Iraqis. The Black Watch's mission added five soldiers and an interpreter.  </p><p>Farmers in India were spraying their crops with Coca-Cola as a cheap alternative to pesticides. A 10-year-old toasted cheese sandwich supposedly featuring an image of the Virgin Mary was put up for auction on eBay, then removed on grounds of taste, even though the owner said it had remained completely uncorrupted during its 10 years. Coca-Cola moved on from the Sidcup tapwater debacle by proposing to lay a pipeline through an area of outstanding natural beauty to get at some more Malvern water. Elsewhere in bottled water, the Fijian variety, flown in from 10,000 miles away, was proving popular. The miraculous toasted cheese sandwich was reinstated and sold to a casino for $28,000.  </p><p>Two sets of extraordinary people confounding previous theories about evolution were discovered in the Pacific: skeletons of a tiny, hairy species of human were found in Indonesia, while Queensland was the setting for I'm A Celebrity ...

The government showed a marked inclination against devolution in other areas, proposing more phone-tapping, compulsory drug-testing, smoking bans, chewing gum restrictions and identity cards. Not everyone was convinced by the argument that these measures were justified because all anti-social behaviour, from over-eating to suicide-bombing, was intimately and causally connected. Others looked forward to a world where thinner non-smokers would gamble and drink all night. This boundary dispute between public responsibility and private liberty was then piquantly pointed up by the confusing behaviour of its chief prosecutor, the aforesaid American-involved blind man. The speed and keenness to order another inquiry was not matched over the continuing scandal at Deepcut Barracks. A fall of 8% in the annual burglary figures was attributed to a decline in demand for secondhand goods. These bad times for the trade were compounded when the burglary of former burglar Ozzy Osbourne prompted calls to allow any retaliation short of ritual disembowelling (which would probably be all right if it was done from the front).  </p><p><strong>December</strong><br /> \nOrange-bedecked Ukranians who had taken to the streets of Kiev to protest against the defeat of their candidate in the presidential election celebrated after a re-run was ordered amid claims of interference from both east and west.   </p><p>Orange-bedecked Ulstermen did not take to the streets of Belfast to celebrate a power-sharing agreement between Ian Paisley's DUP and Gerry Adams's Sinn Fein.  </p><p>Jeanette Winterson opened a delicatessen. Pizza producers complained that the Atkins Diet had doubled world cheese prices in two years. Darfur and other troubled parts of sub-Saharan Africa were still hungry. Bob Geldof was still angry. Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, \"the Lennon and McCartney of global development\" according to Bono, raised hopes that Britain's presidency of the EU and the G8 in 2005 might just possibly spare us another cover of Do They Know It's Christmas?, which was still number one. That is if, of course, they have any time over from sorting out Iraq, helping George Bush with his CO2 habit, general nursing duties and winning the next election.  </p><p>Comedians protested that yet more Home Office legislation would prevent them from making jokes about religions, for God's sake. The Seven Dwarves threatened to quit the Dresden Xmas fair after Snow White was sacked for posing topless. Father Christmas delivered his gifts in Clackmannanshire on behalf of the Alloa Round Table with the help of a police escort after a series of attacks in past years on his sleigh by youths armed with bottles and other missiles, while in Llanelli he was monitored by a camera in his grotto to prevent possible allegations of child abuse.  </p><p>Have a happy one yourself!</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/5087367|2014-05-04T12:09:17Z|ccacd0068c9980cf8e56f94496e401863790fb0b -->",

	"body" : "The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, yesterday accused the US and the European Union of encouraging \"mayhem\" on the streets of Ukraine, and warned them against interfering further in the current election crisis. <P>Speaking after a failed EU-Russia summit in the Hague, he told the international community to let the Ukrainian issue be decided in the courts.  <P>His remarks came as the Ukrainian supreme court blocked Viktor Yanukovich, Russia's favoured candidate who was declared the winner on Wednesday by a 3% margin, from assuming the presidency.  <P>The court said the results could not be officially published until after a hearing on Monday into dozens of complaints from the opposition into alleged election fraud.  <P>Mr Yanukovich cannot become president until the results are officially published.  <P>The opposition leader, Viktor Yushchenko, hailed the court's ruling when he addressed tens of thousands of supporters crowded into Kiev's Independence Square for the fifth day in a row. \"This is only the beginning,\" he said. \"It is proof that it is society that always wins. It is small compensation for the suffering that we have endured.\"  <P>The crisis has the potential to produce the biggest rift between Mr Putin and the US since the Iraq war last year and increase existing tensions between Russia and the EU.  <P>The row overshadowed an EU-Russia summit which was intended to put together a package of measures covering security and trade but which broke up without agreement.  <P>At a press conference afterwards, Mr Putin issued an implicit rebuke to both the US and the EU, though he did not mention either by name. The US has said it will not accept the results as they stand, and the EU has said Sunday's poll was seriously flawed.  <P>Mr Putin suggested they stand aside. \"We should not introduce in the practice of international life a means of addressing similar disputes through mayhem on the street,\" he said. \"All claims should go to the courts.  <P>\"We don't believe it is our right to interfere in any way in the electoral process or impose our opinion on the Ukranian people.\"  <P>Relations between Russia and the EU have been tense much of this year, with Mr Putin unnerved by expansion eastwards of the EU towards Russia.  <P>Moscow overtly supported Mr Yanukovich throughout the campaign. Mr Putin, who visited Kiev twice during the campaign, yesterday sent congratulations to Mr Yanuk-ovich and anticipated him bringing \"the Russian-Ukrainian strategic partnership to a new level\".  <P>A general strike and campaign of civil disobedience, called by the opposition earlier this week and scheduled to begin yesterday, produced only patchy responses.  <P>Markian Bilynskyj, an opposition analyst, said that if the supreme court failed to produce the right result for Mr Yushchenko, his supporters would set about paralysing the country's communications network. He suggested army units in the west could disrupt pipelines carrying Russian gas and oil to Europe.  <P>Ruslana Lezhychko, the Ukrainian winner of the Eurovision song contest, announced a hunger strike in support of the opposition. Hundreds of state TV journalists also began protesting. And last night, approximately 100 members of a police unit went over to the protesters' side - one of them read a statement of support and the crowd shouted \"Good guys!\"  <P>As the crowd showed no signs of ebbing - despite a temperature of minus 6C - hopes of a political compromise that would satisfy both sides seemed to fade.  <P>Mr Yushchenko also ap peared to reject backroom deals saying any negotiations would be \"transparent\".<!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/5072137|2014-05-04T12:09:17Z|9d663e702630d992c2673ec440a7dfdfe2ec47b8 -->",

But Varga, who said on Friday that uncertainty over Tigana's future was the reason for the deal stalling, revealed he has not completely given up hope of doing business with Fulham.        He said:\"If Fulham find someone better, that's up to them. But if they want Sergei, he could play for them. It's still 50-50 and everything could turn in a good direction with Fulham.\" </p><p>Varga's version of events at Fulham's Motspur Park training ground on Thursday and Friday differed from the view of Fulham officials. \"We generally agreed personal terms but no details were discussed,\" he said. \"Sergei had his medical, which went okay and showed he is 100% fit, so we met Tigana but then the meetings stopped.\"     </p><p>Meanwhile Rebrov has dismissed claims that he is suffering from depression following the collapse of the proposed move.</p><p>He has emphatically denied the reports but added he is angry at being left in the dark at White Hart Lane.

Sparkes told the Press Association: \"Another club in the UK, apart from Forest, has expressed an interest. John is predisposed to the idea and the other club would like to have him.\" </p><p>\"The other club are keen to do something about it,\" continued Sparkes. \"But whether it can be pushed to the next stage is another matter. There are only 11 days of the transfer window to go so something has to give.
