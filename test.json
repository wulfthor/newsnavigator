	"body" : "<p>✒ <a href=\"http://www.sajidjavid.com/\" title=\"\">Sajid Javid</a>, David Cameron's emergency replacement for Maria Miller, is manifestly the least-qualified of the coalition government's culture secretaries. Jeremy Hunt had a degree of credibility due to his background in PR and publishing, while Maria Miller had a career in advertising and marketing before becoming an MP. In contrast, Javid's CV, stuffed with impressive banking jobs, includes no relevant experience whatsoever.</p><p>✒ This glaring gap posed no problem for the writers of last week's laudatory and sometimes adulatory profiles in rightwing papers, which Javid, eagerly provided links to on his website: perhaps too eagerly for rival post-Cameron contenders, even including his mentor George Osborne, given their headlines included such phrases as \"tipped as future leader\", \"Maggie's Muslim heir\" and \"could end up at top of Tory tree\". And Javid's lack of cultural hinterland – his Who's Who entry lists no recreations – was acknowledged but relegated to the 14th paragraph of <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/conservative/10757640/Sajid-Javid-the-man-who-thinks-big.html\" title=\"\">Fraser Nelson's Telegraph profile</a> (\"he will stuggle to talk about his great love of the performing arts … It is certainly an odd casting – Javid's expertise is in finance\") and the 23rd of <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2601111/The-Muslim-bus-drivers-son-set-Commons-superstar-ANDREW-PIERCE-new-Culture-Secretary-Sajid-Javid.html\" title=\"\">Andrew Pierce's huzzah in the Mail</a>: \"His knowledge of sport may be scant – he claims to support Manchester United – and few of his friends have heard him talking about culture and the arts.\" All irrelevant, apparently.</p><p>✒ Each piece touching on Javid's nonexistent credentials will have added to the grief of the Hon <a href=\"http://www.vaizey.com/\" title=\"\">Ed Vaizey</a>, who – since he's been at the DCMS since the coalition came to power, as well as being a leading art critic's son – has the expertise his new boss lacks. Overlooked again, he might well be wondering who's more insulting to lose out to – Maria Miller, or a media and culture know-nothing? Clearly one of the amiable under-minister's handicaps on this occasion was the difficulty of handing over one of Miller's other jobs to him (in contrast to Javid, who has taken her equalities role), as neither being a toff nor being chubby  – \"I am an obese man!\" he once told a stunned audience – currently qualifies for discriminated-against minority status. He may need to develop lifestyle choices that put him in a better position next time, such as turning his hair ginger or becoming a goth. Omitting mention of his public school, as he does on his website's \"About Ed\" section, is a sensible start to this brand-building. Oxford must go next.</p><p>✒ In a splendid week for hairless men, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/apr/06/telegraph-jason-seiken-digital-saviour-familiar-route\" title=\"\">Telegraph editor-in-chief Jason Seiken</a> shared his ideas on the need for newsrooms to be dominated by \"digital natives\" in a visionary address at the Newsworks conference. Telegraph toilers too mature or luddite to qualify (digital incomers? Digital foreigners?) will have been alarmed by his blunt implicit message for them, but compelling too was his sketch of a topsy-turvy ethos modelled on \"his last job at PBS\" where he \"created a 'failure goal' that penalised staff who did not fail enough\". As he explained: \"It meant they weren't challenging themselves enough, they were playing it safe. At the Telegraph that's the digital native culture we embrace.\" Monkey (and doubtless the paper's star writers such as Peter Oborne, Boris Johnson, Allison Pearson and Matthew Norman) can't wait for the first failure league tables to be leaked.</p><p>✒ Meanwhile, two former Telegraph editors were once again entertainingly at loggerheads, this time over Maria Miller. With his stint as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/mediamonkeyblog/2014/feb/25/telegraph-editor-waiting-tony-gallagher\" title=\"\">work-experience chef in a London restaurant over, Tony Gallagher</a> had plenty of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gallaghereditor\" title=\"\">time to tweet about the minister's downfall being long overdue</a>, having driven the paper's campaign against her before <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/jan/21/tony-gallagher-exits-daily-telegraph-editor\" title=\"\">he was sacked after Seiken's arrival</a>. Over in the <a href=\"http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/charles-moore/2014/04/maria-miller-should-not-have-resigned/\" title=\"\">Spectator, in contrast, Charles Moore</a> (once described by Gallagher in an email to a colleague as a \"tw*t\") called Miller's resignation \"a disgrace\" and denounced \"the press anger\" that he believed forced her to go as \"confected\". It's a feud promisingly turning into Torydum v Torydee.</p><p>✒ Also in the Spectator, Daily Mail columnist Jan Moir revealed that her octogenarian mother, who reads the paper on her iPad, seems to treat Moir's rants much like many of her critics: \"She now bypasses my articles completely and goes straight to the reader comments, which she adores. The more brutal and rude they are about me, the deeper her enjoyment.\"</p><p>✒ Coverage of last week's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/apr/07/bafta-tv-award-nominations-full-list\" title=\"\">Bafta TV nominations</a>, being naturally drawn to stars, dramas and reality shows, tended to overlook how awful for the BBC the journalism categories were, just as in the recent RTS journalism awards. In current affairs, the empire James Harding inherited was shut out completely, with all four nominations going to Channel 4 (which also easily won the overall battle, with 27 noms compared to 17 apiece for BBC1 and BBC2 and 12 for ITV); and in news coverage the mighty network news machine (aka \"snoozegathering\") again no-scored, although a BBC Northwest Tonight special did get the nod alongside two ITV reports and one from Channel 4. For a BBC now run by its former emperor of news, this is pretty shaming.</p><p>✒ Kim Shillinglaw, new controller of BBC2 and BBC4, inherits a rich legacy from her predecessor Janice Hadlow, including the substantial <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2014/eighteenth-century-britain.html\" title=\"\">18th-century season</a> that is already unfolding on the two channels and looks likely to climax in early May when \"history pixie\" Lucy Worsley completes her three-parter, The First Georgians. In a curious coincidence, the first week of May was the date originally announced for Hadlow's long-awaited first book, about the private life of George III (worryingly, her publishers seem unsure what they're calling it, The Strangest Family or A Royal Experiment); now its publication has been moved to summer, the season won't be quite so close in timing but is still bound to leave viewers eager to learn more about those beguiling Georgians.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/434343810|2014-05-04T10:23:41Z|77b2ba0f7294abddc11c45d9d6d51db572e65e71 -->",

	"body" : "<p>There was one dreadful hole in the profusion of punditry last week. What does Maria Miller's abrupt departure mean for culture, media and sport? Answers, please, alongside a detailed assessment of her contribution to coalition policymaking, on a very small postcard. And cough with due embarrassment before saying: \"Not much.\"</p><p>Yet \"not much\" it is and very little it will probably remain for the next 13&nbsp;months as her successor, Sajid Javid, basks in golden opinions (\"The first of Thatcher's children has arrived\": Tim Montgomerie, the <em>Times</em>) and prepares, along the way, to be the first son of a Pakistani bus driver who may (or may not) become our prime minister.</p><p>For the difficulty – one that afflicted Mrs Miller just as surely as it will leave Mr Javid twiddling his thumbs – is that&nbsp;the DCMS isn't much of a department. Basically, it takes money (well over a billion from lottery and Treasury) and distributes it to dozens of quangoid organisations who reach their own conclusions about how to spend it. Just \"a funnel\", says Philip Collins in the&nbsp;<em>Times</em>.</p><p>We're here \"to help make Britain the world's most creative and exciting place to live, visit and do business\", says the requisite mission statement, linking \"artistic heritage\", community \"growth\" and \"fantastic tourism\" in a bumper bundle that also protects \"deeply held beliefs on freedom and equality\" in \"the global race for economic success\". All of which sounds, on examination, rather like the scenario for a new series of <em>W1A</em>.</p><p>Miller didn't have to make challenging speeches, so she didn't. Nor, whatever the conspiracy theorists may think, was she truly in charge of any power-tinged processes. Leveson and the royal charter? A wheeze cooked up by Oliver Letwin in the Cabinet Office and implemented in a dazed rush by David Cameron – and whatever Westminster says, it's dead in the water until way past the general election. The BBC's licence fee? Foisted on a hapless director general by the PM himself last time around and sure to be clutched to the bosom of Downing Street yet again come 2016. Plurality and the menace of Sky? BT has seen that one off <em>pro tem</em>.</p><p>Secretaries of state at culture (and national heritage before that) organise consultations, supervise appointments, commission reports, go to Covent Garden. But they don't organise the Olympic Games. That's Seb Coe's triumph. They don't run the arts. That's Arts Council business. Nor the big issues of broadcasting. Call for&nbsp;Ofcom.</p><p>They may be allowed a few little wheezes of their own. Jeremy Hunt sought to kickstart 50 or so local TV stations. They may harbour grand ambitions for broadband in an interconnected world. But there have been 12 cabinet culture supremos in 22 years, a shuffling, shifting trickle of talent passing through. There's no day-to-day function they perform that couldn't be farmed out to No&nbsp;10, business, the Home Office, health and more. The British Museum, the Churches Conservation Trust and the Horserace Betting Levy Board don't fit under the same umbrella – let alone jostle in any global race for economic&nbsp;success.</p><p>Javid may be as remarkable as his friends proclaim. He's certainly formidably numerate and Treasury-trained. But anyone who expects to see him happy to remain as top dog at 100&nbsp;Parliament Street in 13 months' time is seriously deluded. And wan thanks to Miller, plus all her outraged headlines, for making the point. Empty vessels generate the most noise.</p><p>■ No one of any weight, from Michael Gove to Sajid Javid to the editor of the <em>Times</em>, thinks her ministerial Leveson link is what sunk Maria Miller. An irritant with a special adviser itch, perhaps, but nothing more. Half-a-million outraged tweets after that cursory non-apology did far more damage.</p><p>Yet there is one fundamental factor here that both politicians and press ought to ponder. Simply, that they don't just stand on different barricades, waving their fists, because they can't agree about charters, independent regulators and sundry rulebooks. They're on a different sides because that's where they're supposed to be, caught in constant fusillades of charge, counter-charge.</p><p>Of course that's not a stupid game to be pursued willy-nilly; sometimes only cynicism and destruction follow in train. It is, though, basic positioning – and one great reason why even perfect regulation will never guarantee perfect peace.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/434303675|2014-05-04T10:23:41Z|386c9d0c54d40bc48cc744ba57cda523b9821c62 -->",

	"body" : "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture-professionals-network/culture-professionals-blog/2014/apr/09/maria-miller-resignation-impact-arts-culture\" title=\"\">The resignation of Maria Miller</a> and the appointment of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/apr/09/sajid-javid-replaces-maria-miller-cabinet-culture\" title=\"\">Sajid Javid</a> leaves several possibilities open for DCMS. Miller had done very well on parts of policy that DCMS was responsible for, including <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/mar/29/gay-couples-wed-same-sex-marriage\" title=\"\">equal marriage</a>, but had faced criticism on some of the core policy areas, including the arts. Indeed, there was somewhat of a drift in arts policy, which under Miller's tenure did not seem to have a clear purpose or function, aside from deficit reduction.</p><p>While Javid will only be in the role for a year before the election this should not be an argument for stasis. DCMS presents a fascinating opportunity for Javid to make a mark as both a competent minister and to the broader themes of deficit and growth that have dominated the coalition's time in office. His background in banking and at the Treasury suggests there may be some innovative thinking in cultural policy, particularly in reference to the economic aspects of culture, which has been almost wholly absent in recent years.</p><p>Obviously there will be major issues to confront as the next round of Arts Council England (ACE) funding is decided. Inevitably there will be political fallout as funding reductions will lead to reductions in the number and variety of arts organisations receiving investment from ACE. This may represent the first challenge for the new minster – a challenge that will be concurrent with the recent <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture-professionals-network/culture-professionals-blog/2014/feb/17/fair-arts-funding-england-government\" title=\"\">Culture Media and Sport (CMS) select committee work</a> on the regional aspects of arts funding.</p><p>The CMS report and an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture-professionals-network/culture-professionals-blog/2013/oct/31/london-bias-arts-funding-report\" title=\"\">overly metropolitan focus</a> of ACE funds on the \"crown jewels\" of London's art scene may well demand that Javid comments on both DCMS' vision for regional arts policy and the continued viability of ACE's arm's length principle that absolves DCMS responsibility for the clear funding inequalities in England. This is to say nothing of the issues associated with media policy in the post-Leveson era.</p><p>The opportunities once these potential pitfalls are crossed centre around the emergence of a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/271008/Creative_Industries_Economic_Estimates_-_January_2014.pdf\" title=\"\">new agenda for the creative industries (pdf)</a> that has so far been driven by DCMS bureaucracy and organisations such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture-professionals-network/culture-professionals-blog/2012/apr/03/innovation-arts-culture-nesta-fund\" title=\"\">NESTA</a>. </p><p>Working with the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills to establish the creative industries as a priority sector for economic growth and development (or industrial policy as such activities used to be known) would help to build in the \"creative intensity\" model of understanding the economic role of the creative industries recently adopted by DCMS.</p><p>While creative industries policy is unlikely to win votes on the doorstep directly, it must contribute to the vision of the British economy offered at the next election. The march of the makers was, at very best, uneven under the coalition; the rebalancing sought by Osborne failed to materialise. The creative industries are something <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/creative-industries-worth-8million-an-hour-to-uk-economy\" title=\"\">Britain is clearly good at</a> and one would hope someone with Treasury experience and networks could push this agenda further as manifestos are written.</p><p>However these opportunities will require Javid to address the fundamental problem facing DCMS: it has no clear and coherent cultural policy. While delivering the London 2012 Olympic Games, encouraging philanthropy and developing the local cultural infrastructure associated with broadband and television were specific policy aims, there has been little to indicate a grand vision coming from ministers.</p><p>The overriding function of cultural policy under the coalition was folded into deficit reduction, whether via cuts or by contributing to growth. The lack of coherent cultural policy is something with which Britain has traditionally struggled, irrespective of the party in government. </p><p>Javid could make a lasting mark on DCMS and on culture in the UK by addressing this point. To do so will require a vision of what culture is for and what the function of cultural policy will be. This would do much to clarify the future of funding as well as the potential for culture to contribute to economic growth.</p><p><em>Dave O'Brien is lecturer in cultural and creative industries at </em><a href=\"http://www.city.ac.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>City University, London</em></a><em> – follow him on Twitter </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/DrDaveOBrien\" title=\"\"><em>@DrDaveOBrien</em></a></p><p><strong>Join our community of arts, culture and creative professionals by signing up free to the </strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/culture-professionals/\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Culture Pros Network</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/434232810|2014-05-04T10:23:41Z|81b223c8b123d7e2e35c7ec317073b5e072dd52a -->",

	"body" : "<p>So <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/apr/09/maria-miller-quits-pm-sleaze\" title=\"\">farewell then, Maria Miller</a>, the minister who made more of a splash with her drawn-out departure than she managed to achieve during four years in government office. She spent 18 months in the cabinet at the ministry of culture, overseeing a hotchpotch of responsibilities from ballet and broadband to table tennis and tourism. Yet the best defence that could be made of her work was that she steered through gay marriage so successfully.</p><p>This was a noble achievement, especially in the face of fire from the misanthropic right. But pause for a second: why did this important social reform came under the wing of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport? Traditionally, such issues have been handled by the Home Office, as a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/23/roy-jenkins-well-rounded-life-review-chris-mullin\" title=\"\">new biography of Roy Jenkins</a> reminds us, but the cautious Theresa May was&nbsp;reportedly reluctant to handle such&nbsp;an explosive issue.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/apr/09/sajid-javid-replaces-maria-miller-cabinet-culture\" title=\"\">Miller's replacement</a> is an impressive&nbsp;character, the son of an immigrant bus driver who has become the first elected politician of Asian descent to reach the cabinet. But apart from an enthusiasm for Star Trek, Sajid Javid is&nbsp;better known for his business brain than any love of arts or sport. So given the reluctance to hand the job to a genuine champion of culture, would it&nbsp;not make more sense to simply abolish the entire department?</p><p>This is not to reheat tired arguments&nbsp;over the need for state subsidies of arts – although it is worth noting in passing that some of the most&nbsp;innovative creative industries in&nbsp;this country are those which receive&nbsp;less support such as design, fashion, pop music and video games. Equally, while right to highlight the astonishing success of this incredibly vibrant sector, it is depressing when so&nbsp;many politicians seek to reduce art to&nbsp;its&nbsp;economic value.</p><p>There needs to be a minister accountable for the significant sums spent. But this person should be an advocate of the arts willing to stir debate on something so central to life and national wellbeing. Perhaps this is a&nbsp;pipedream in our anti-politics age – but&nbsp;it would be good to hear a senior figure stoking discussion about design of tower blocks or the latest show at Tate Modern. Instead, this important job gets handed to ambitious party hacks on the rise who alight on something safe such as the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-12220187\" title=\"\">pointless import of US-style local television</a> to aid their careers.</p><p>Sure, they get a seat at the cabinet table – yet the ministry itself has almost ceased to&nbsp;exist. After slashing staff budgets, the&nbsp;department was shunted last year from its own office into the Treasury, where it sits squashed on to one floor beside the nation's tax collectors. \"It's been axed to the bone,\" said one political insider. This seems symbolic, reflecting the importance given to a department that has been something of a misfit since its birth two decades ago.</p><p>It was created as the <a href=\"http://blogs.culture.gov.uk/main/2012/04/it_was_20_years_ago_today.html\" title=\"\">Department of National Heritage</a> by John Major, days after he won the 1992 general election so unexpectedly. This was widely assumed to have been a gift for his friend and fellow Chelsea fan, David Mellor, partly as reward for steering the sale of ITV franchises as a junior home office minister. But he survived just five months before being forced out by his own handling of <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/september/24/newsid_2529000/2529115.stm\" title=\"\">unfortunate press revelations</a>.</p><p>For all his faults, Mellor had passion about and profound knowledge of the subjects in his red boxes, unlike his three Tory successors who filled his post over the following five years. New Labour typically rebranded the department and gave the job to another arts lover, Chris Smith – but then under Gordon Brown's premiership it became a political football again, and was handed to three rising Westminster stars in three years. Now we are on our third minister of fun under the coalition.</p><p>The legacy of these machinations is a ministry that has the smallest budget of any spending department, is shunned by the best civil servants and lacks sense, shape or purpose. Much of the key work on regulation and distribution of funding is carried out by quangos. Meanwhile tourism and media would be more logically placed under the business brief, equalities is a fudged mess, and many in heritage would prefer to sit alongside planning at Communities and Local Government.</p><p>The DCMS bungled the rollout of superfast broadband, which was found to be running some <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/3f7d56ea-be81-11e3-a1bf-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2yVGmOgKw\" title=\"\">£200m over budget and two years late</a>. This would be better&nbsp;bundled alongside digital inclusion and&nbsp;cyber-security at the Cabinet Office in a beefed-up digital department, given&nbsp;the crucial importance of this sector to Britain's future. It was noticeable, incidentally, the prime minister himself rather than Miller took the lead on the issue of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/jul/22/david-cameron-crackdown-internet-pornography\" title=\"\">access to online pornography</a> – while the&nbsp;handling of press regulation has been botched from start to finish.</p><p>There are too many government departments – their existence, titles and responsibilities often the result of political horse-trading rather than the needs of the nation. Few ministries demonstrate this better than the shrivelled, muddled and sometimes-misfiring department of culture, media, sport and many other things from gambling to wartime commemorations.</p><p>Yet there is no chance of either main party delivering the coup de grace, given the furious outcry and accusations of philistinism that would ensue. So instead we limp on with the current compromise, another messy cosmetic solution to the real needs of the nation.</p><p><em>Twitter: </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ianbirrell\" title=\"\"><em>@ianbirrell</em></a></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/434252406|2014-05-04T10:23:41Z|46b5c7341df71eb908cfd9f0943af02876b52eec -->",

	"body" : "<p>When Tony Blair, on his first day as premier in 1997, created a new super-ministry to replace the previous Conservative administration's Department of National Heritage, he called it Culture, Media and Sport. But, although the c-word was given first place on the letterhead, it has been the other two responsibilities that have most preoccupied DCMS secretaries of state, for good or ill.</p><p>Sport, in the form of the securing and then execution of the 2012 Olympics, provided the post's crowning glory so far – while the media have proved to be its crown of thorns. Maria Miller, who resigned yesterday after facing sustained pressure over an excessive expenses claim, is the second holder of the position in a row to depart with their head caught in journalistic cross-hairs. Just 18 months ago, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/sep/04/jeremy-hunt-health-secretary-cabinet-reshuffle\" title=\"\">Jeremy Hunt was moved to health</a> following controversy over his alleged over-closeness to the Murdoch empire, in an industry it was his responsibility to regulate.</p><p>Because both newspapers and games are generally noisier creatures than culture, an incumbent's efforts on behalf of the first word in their brief are often overlooked. But, even so, Miller has made notably little impact on the arts. Whereas the first secretary of state at the DCMS, Chris Smith, was (like the first heritage secretary, David Mellor) someone frequently to be seen at theatres or in CD shops, Miller always felt more of a media figure.</p><p>Most cultural initiatives during her time at the DCMS – appeals to keep rare paintings or books in Britain, grants to museums and galleries, reform of the heritage rules – have been presented to the public by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/ed-vaizey\" title=\"\">Ed Vaizey</a>, her very able minister for culture. Miller herself led the press releases and conferences relating to a new cultural agreement with China and the nomination of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/jan/24/scotlands-forth-bridge-world-heritage\" title=\"\">Forth bridge for World Heritage Site</a> status, but both those campaigns felt more driven by wider politics – David Cameron's desire to keep China and Scotland, for different reasons, sweet – than by any personal artistic vision.</p><p>To be fair to her, the aspect of the cultural portfolio that attracts most attention, the provision of funds to the Arts Council, is an almost impossible game to win. If the figure is lower than theatres and museums hoped for, the DCMS takes the blame; but if it is higher, then the prime minister and chancellor of the exchequer are prone to claim the credit. Serving in a time of cuts, Miller became the target for angry rhetoric from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/national-theatre\" title=\"\">National Theatre</a> boss Nicholas Hytner and other cultural leaders about what they saw as her refusal to understand the economic value of the arts to Britain.</p><p>But if Miller appears to have achieved little at the DCMS, she might argue that she had no time to complete, or even really start, her work. Her departure solidifies the department's reputation for having an ejector seat behind its biggest desk. Although it is the Home Office that traditionally has the reputation as the riskiest cabinet position, the DCMS has now had eight bosses since 1997. And, as Tessa Jowell accounted for six of those 17 years, none of Miller's five other Labour or coalition predecessors completed two years in the post. Continuing this trend, even if he avoids trouble, her successor, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/apr/09/sajid-javid-breaks-tory-mould-maria-miller\" title=\"\">Sajid Javid</a>, will have barely 12 months before parliament is dissolved ahead of the May 2015 election.</p><p>One brief incumbent – Labour's Andy Burnham – left in 2009 because he was fast-tracked for promotion, but the majority have gone unwillingly and/or unpleasantly. You don't have to believe in post-Leveson \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/apr/06/maria-miller-witch-hunt-iain-duncan-smith\" title=\"\">media witch hunts</a>\", as some of Miller's supporters apparently do, to see that the holder of a cabinet position that includes oversight of the press may invite particularly brutal scrutiny of their conduct. Even the department's great survivor, Tessa Jowell (2001-07), experienced a lengthy scandal over her husband's business affairs.</p><p>But the mayfly careers that have become common in this position have also had consequences for the department's political responsibilities. Given the general estimate that it takes at least a year for a fresh secretary of state to impose their will, the DCMS has been under full control for less than half of this parliament and, by the time Javid gets his feet properly under the desk, he may also be out. It is little wonder that some of the ministry's clients, especially in the arts, complain of a lack of continuity and achievement.</p><p>If the DCMS is retained by the next government, the PM may find it tough to select secretaries of state who are sufficiently newspaper-proof to survive. But in the cause of improving relations with the cultural community, they might also be wise to choose someone who, like Mellor and Smith, gives the impression of having art in their heart. Miller always felt more at home with the media, even though they eventually made her ministerially homeless.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/434148505|2014-05-04T10:23:41Z|d7ece1c7259f764a82f6d2864945a57d13056931 -->",

	"body" : "<p>Maria Miller, 50, member of parliament for Basingstoke and former minister for the disabled. This is how she was described when catapulted into the cabinet as secretary of state for culture, media and sport in September 2012; it's the kind of detail you need to give when writing about someone your readers have never heard.</p><p>But she had ticked several boxes for David Cameron back then: elected in 2005, so no apparent baggage; a professional background (in advertising and PR) rather than a political wonk in the Miliband/Osborne mould; pugnacious; and the biggest tick of all, she was a woman. Although it was of no particular interest that she had no background in culture or sport.</p><p>Will she be missed? Er, not really, either in or out of DCMS. Although she has kept the damage to subsidy to a minimum after the depredations of her predecessor, it has been noted that throughout the whole of Derry-Londonderry's year as the first UK city of culture in 2013, the culture secretary couldn't find the time to visit the city once. She was attacked in the press for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/charlottehigginsblog/2013/jun/11/maria-miller-arts-policy\" title=\"\">underperforming</a> – and in the Daily Mail Quentin Letts found her convicted of the worst of political crimes, that of being boring.</p><p>She needed to come up with something, not only for herself but for her department. When the coalition government came in, no one gave much chance of DCMS surviving at all, and it was saved by the Olympics. Not only did the Games go well, the Cultural Olympiad, taken by the scruff of the neck by Tony Hall and Ruth Mackenzie, was acclaimed by a delighted public and by artists suddenly in demand.</p><p>A year later, however, the point of DCMS was once again being questioned, and Miller came up with a stroke of near genius. The story goes that, sitting uneasily in cabinet, she had asked what was being done officially to mark the centenary of the first world war, and was met with awkward glances at the stuccoed ceiling and the blank defence secretary.</p><p>She decided to take it on, held a hasty press conference at which she was flanked, rather bizarrely, by the communities secretary Eric Pickles, and announced that the Great War would be commemorated, not celebrated, through art. She took £10m from the lottery funds of the Arts Council and the Heritage Lottery Fund, appointed one of the project directors of the London 2012 Festival to put a programme together, and left it to the experts to double the money and commission the art.</p><p>The result has been a programme, announced a couple of weeks ago, stretching across four years that is both inspiring and sensitive, aimed at ignoring the politics of the whole thing but grasping the human impacts.</p><p>And, after a plea last year for evidence to show <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/apr/24/british-culture-commodity-maria-miller\" title=\"\">what culture contributes to the economy</a>, she has also been able to take the arts' earning power to the Treasury and avoid the further cuts many were expecting in the budget last month. The data was all in the public domain, but she saw it as important to be seen and heard asking, showing at last a respect for the artocracy.</p><p>More impressively, she has listened to her culture minister, Ed Vaizey, who has tax breaks for the arts close to his heart and who has also weathered the Hunt winter. He also got the kind of rebates the government gives to film production <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/mar/19/theatres-tax-break-15m-touring-productions-west-end-regional-chancellor-george-osborne\" title=\"\">offered to theatre production</a>, though the complexities of the scheme are still being deciphered by Arts Council England.</p><p>But, unlike in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture-professionals-network/culture-professionals-blog/2013/nov/18/creative-britain-chris-smith-2013\" title=\"\">the golden days of Chris Smith</a>, secretaries of state for culture, media and sport are not appointed for their love of the arts. Miller wasn't, nor will her successor be. And so she won't be missed, but what she has done that her predecessor was unable to do was to keep her hands off and let the cultural sector get on with it – an attitude we all hope her successor will follow.</p><p><strong>Join our community of arts, culture and creative professionals by signing up free to the </strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/culture-professionals/\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Culture Pros Network</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/434099052|2014-05-04T10:23:41Z|212511697e607428678932c6ba9fe08a4456aa54 -->",

As a working mother, educated at a South Wales comprehensive school, I know that it is our party that understands the importance of giving everyone the opportunity to succeed regardless of where they come from.</p><p>I am immensely proud of what my team have been able to achieve during my time in Government: ensuring that our arts and cultural institutions receive the rightful recognition that they deserve in making Britain Great; putting women front and centre of every aspect of DCMS's work; putting in place the legislation to enable all couples to have the opportunity to marry regardless of their sexuality.</p><p>Of course, implementing the recommendations made by Lord Justice Leveson on the future of media regulation, following the phone hacking scandals, would always be controversial for the press. Working together with you, I believe we struck the right balance between protecting the freedom of the press and ensuring fairness, particularly for victims of press intrusion to have a clear right of redress.</p><p>I will continue to support you and the work of the Government as you move forward. Ensuring the best future for the people of Basingstoke has been my priority throughout the last nine years. Whether on the front or back benches of the House of Commons I will continue this work.</p><p>The only reason I was able to become an MP and indeed a government minister and cabinet minister is because of the unstinting support of my husband, my mother, my father and my three children.

As Culture Secretary, you have played a critical role in advancing Britain's proud record of respect and equality in piloting the Equal Marriage Act through Parliament and onto the Statute Book. There are many people in our country today, and there will be many in the future, who will always be grateful for this very important change, which you did so much to bring about. You have also handled the sensitive subject of press regulation with skill and dedication.</p><p>You can be very proud as well that you have led one of the most important infrastructure projects: many more premises are now able to access super-fast broadband . You have also ensured a lasting legacy for the Olympic Games.</p><p>As you leave the Government, you should be proud of your service on the Frontbench and in Opposition.</p><p>I am personally very grateful for the support you have always given me, and which I am sure that you will continue to give.

But this is a critique from three Establishment individuals, appointed because they were deemed fair-minded and committed to high standards in public life (and, presumably, not hostile to parliament), who for the last 12 months have had a much better &quot;inside view&quot; into the way the Commons standards committee works than any outsiders in the past.</p><p>And they have concluded that the system is flawed.</p><p>Here are the main points they make.</p><p><b>• They call for a &quot;fundamental rewrite&quot; of the rules governing the conduct of MPs.</b></p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>A fundamental rewrite of The Code of Conduct and The Guide to the Rules, with close attention given to the way in which these are presented and communicated, would, in our opinion, help ensure that these important documents are both seen to be fit for purpose and future proofed for the digital world and for the next Parliament. </p></blockquote><p><b>• They reveal that some MPs claim to be &quot;too busy&quot; for standards.</b></p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>Several of those we have met have said that Elected Members were often ‘too busy to spend much time on standards.’</p></blockquote><p><b>• The lay members suggest that MPs have just paid &quot;lip service&quot; to standards in the past.</b></p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>If the House is to show that it is not just paying lip service to the importance of high standards then, in our view, more needs to be done to ensure that leadership (one of the seven principles of public life), is shown in this area. We observe that the extent to which the Committee on Standards should lead in this area, and be at the forefront of championing wider cultural change, would be worth exploring. </p></blockquote><p><b>• They say the Commons should produce a clear statement about what the role of an MP is. </b></p><p><b>• They say the absence of such a statement has allowed some MPs to say they don't know how they should behave.</b></p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>Once the high level ‘core purpose’ of an Elected Member’s role has been described / clarified, setting and assessing the standards of conduct which Members should meet can become more focused.</p><p>Over the last twelve months, the Lay Members have observed that the fragmentation of the current standards system has enabled some to say that the conduct which is expected from them is unclear. The opaqueness of the letter of the law has the potential to enable those so minded to ignore the spirit of the law, as encapsulated in the seven principles of public life. In our view, even once the Guide to the Rules is tightened up, this will remain a risk unless it is made clear that behavior will always be interpreted within the context of the spirit of the law.</p></blockquote><p><b>• The lay members virtually accuse the Commons of hypocrisy - saying it imposes standards on other bodies that it does not always follow itself.</b></p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>From the public point of view, Elected Members set the rules / laws that the rest of the population live by. The Lay Members note that some of the rules that have been set for both public facing organisations and private corporations (e.g. expectations of behavior, commitment to openness and transparency or staff disciplinary procedures) do not appear to be fully followed by the House itself.</p></blockquote><p><b>• They suggest that a system of double standards has been allowed to apply in the past.</b><br /></p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>When Elected Members decide that different standards of behaviour are acceptable from them, as compared to other external public figures, we are of the view that a clear evidence base should always be used, and communicated, to publicly explain the reasons for this decision. </p></blockquote><p><b>• They reveal that MPs on the standards committee sometimes miss meetings because they have other engagements.</b> Once this meant the lay members were paid to attend a meeting that had to be cancelled.</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>Over the last year we have observed the heavy and demanding workloads required of Elected Members [of the standards committee]. Many will frequently be scheduled to be in one or more meetings at the same time that the Standards Committee is meeting, as well as having to prepare for debates and deal with mounting constituency business. On one occasion this led to a situation where only the Lay Members were present with the Chair and the Clerk at a Committee meeting, although we were assured that this had not happened previously. This rendered the Committee non-quorate and must be considered unacceptable given the cost to the public purse.</p></blockquote><p><b>• The lay members say it is not entirely clear who is in charge of the self-regulation process.</b></p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>It is also currently unclear who is in the ‘strategic driving seat’ in the Committee.

But it fleshes it out. And it's an important speech, because it proposes a significant transfer of power away from Whitehall (or what looks like a beefed-up version of the city deal programme already pioneered by the government).<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/feb/09/ed-miliband-labour-parents-headteachers\"> In his Hugo Young lecture in February Miliband presented himself as a genuine decentraliser; </a>today's speech suggests that he really meant it.</p><p>Here are the key points.</p><p><b>• Ed Miliband said the government had to do much more to promote growth outside London. </b>The coalition is also committed to this goal, but Miliband said that its policies were not working.</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>The country that once built its prosperity on the great towns and cities, like Birmingham, Bristol, Liverpool, Leeds, Manchester, Glasgow and Cardiff, has become a country which doesn’t do enough to build prosperity in England outside one great capital city: London ...</p><p>London and the South-East of England was responsible for 37 per cent of the UK's growth in the decade before the financial crisis.</p><p> And in the years since 2010 that share has risen to 54 per cent.</p><p>More than half the growth of the whole of our country taking place in London and the south-east ...</p><p>Britain will never be able to tackle the cost-of-living crisis and create the new jobs that are essential to it, unless we break this pattern.</p></blockquote><p><br /><b>• He said all parties were to blame for the &quot;century-long centralisation of England&quot;.</b></p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>Governments of both parties have not done nearly enough to give the tools to the brilliant people, talented individuals, dynamic businesses of our great towns and cities to do the job they want to do.</p></blockquote><p><b>• He praised <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/no-stone-unturned-in-pursuit-of-growth\">the report that Lord Heseltine compiled for the government, No Stone Unturned, proposing economic decentralisation to the regions.</a></b></p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>Lord Heseltine’s review called for massive funding to be devolved to Britain’s cities. </p><p>And they flunked the test.<br /></p><p>Cities like Birmingham put in the work to prepare for it.<br /></p><p>But David Cameron and George Osborne allocated just &pound;2bn for a Local Growth Fund in their Spending Review.<br /></p><p> Just a fifth of what Michael Heseltine asked for.</p><p>The best report this government has produced has been the one that they have most ignored.<br /></p><p>We can and must do a lot better than that.</p></blockquote><p><b>• Miliband said Labour would devolve new powers to city-regions. </b>This is how the party explained it in a briefing note.</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>Ed Miliband and Ed Balls are today writing to all local authorities, universities and LEPs [local enterprise partnership] setting out this road map and inviting them to prepare plans meeting the conditions which could be brought forward early in the next Parliament. </p><p> Authorities which bring forward plans in the first nine months of the next Parliament will in return receive a devolution deal finalised in the first spending review period of a Labour Government.</p><p> In the next stage of his review, Lord Adonis will build on the approach set out by Lord Heseltine’s Review. The Heseltine Review set out an “indicative list of central budgets” which could be considered for devolution over four years. But the Government allocated just &pound;2bn for a Local Growth Fund in their Spending Review for 2015-16. Lord Adonis has been asked by Ed Miliband to go further and examine every line of the spending set out by Lord Heseltine so that significantly more funding can be devolved.</p></blockquote><p>And this is how Labour explained what councils and LEPs would have to do to get money from central government.</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>1. Putting in place stronger political governance to drive economic leadership and decision-taking at city-region and county-region level.</p><p>2. Properly integrating a single Local Enterprise Partnership working closely with, but entirely independent of, the combined authority so that businesses are fully engaged in decision making and signed up to the local blueprint.</p><p>3. Developing an economic strategy, clearly focused on the creation of well paid jobs and reducing any productivity gap between the city region and top performing regions of the UK.</p></blockquote><p><b>• Miliband accused the government of not creating enough good jobs.</b></p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>In the last few years, we’ve seen employment in low paid sectors rise twice as fast as in higher paid sectors. </p><p>George Osborne thinks that creating more and more insecure, low paid, low skilled jobs is good enough as an answer to our country’s cost-of-living crisis.</p><p>It isn’t.<br /></p><p>That is why he’s part of the problem.<br /></p><p>Not the solution.<br /></p></blockquote><p>This contrasts with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2014/apr/07/maria-millers-expenses-controversy-latest-developments-politics-live-blog#block-5342b033e4b03e953afa2e6f\">what Iain Duncan Smith said yesterday, when he defended the idea of getting the unemployed into minimum wage jobs.</a></p><p><b>• Miliband said that George Osborne should have acknowledged the importance of full employment long before now.</b></p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>Now, I welcome the chancellor’s apparent conversion to the cause of full employment.</p><p>It is 70 years after a British government first dedicated itself to it.</p><p>I guess better late than never.</p></blockquote><p><b>• Miliband said that the Tories were wrong if they thought the living standards crisis was close to being over.</b><br /></p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>Because they tell us that very soon, on one measure, average wage rises will overtake the level of inflation.</p><p> I hope that happens as soon as possible.</p><p>And any progress in people’s living standards is a good thing.<br /></p><p>But it is time the Conservative Party got in touch with reality.<br /></p><p>And here’s a way to do it.<br /></p><p>I suggest to Conservative candidates and the Prime Minister that they go on the doorstep of families in Britain and tell them:<br /></p><p>“Hello I am from the Conservative party.”<br /></p><p>“And I am here to tell you the average of wages has overtaken the CPI measure of inflation and so I can tell you that your cost-of-living crisis is over.”<br /></p></blockquote> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5343d2cbe4b053db358db080\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-04-08T11:45:25.819+01:00\">11.45am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Ed Miliband has been taking questions about the Maria Miller affair at his speech in Birmingham.

In her evidence to the watchdog, she repeatedly insisted that she spent more nights in her constituency residence than in her larger home in Wimbledon. </p><p> However, Phil Heath, a former Conservative councillor and deputy mayor who worked on the MP’s election campaign, told BBC South: “She would come back once every couple of weeks on a Friday to do a surgery then she’d be sheepishly back up to London — her family were there, her children were there. Her house in Basingstoke, whenever we had a meeting there, there was no family there. So that was definitely her second home.” </p><p> A Tory Party spokesman questioned Mr Heath’s impartiality, saying: “Phil Heath was expelled from the Conservative Party for aggressive behaviour.

But, as Goldsmith points out, under Nick Clegg's plan (he's in charge of this legislation), the committee that would decide whether or not to allow a recall would be the same one, the standards committee, that watered down the report saying Miller should pay back &pound;45,000.</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>When it comes to the technicalities of financial wrongdoing, it probably makes sense for a specialised independent body to lay out the facts, and make recommendations.</p><p>But what seems to have slipped the net in recent debates is the fact that we already have an independent body, capable and uniquely qualified to pass judgment on MPs. It’s called the electorate. The only difficulty, for now, is that they don’t have the powers to do so.</p><p>I have no idea what sort of constituency MP Maria Miller is, but I am certain that, in a mature and functioning democracy, her constituents should be able to hold her to account at all times, and not just at the election. If events cause a majority of constituents to lose confidence in their MP, they should have the right to remove that MP. It is a right that shouldn’t be limited to issues of expenses.

Nan Sloane, director of the Centre for Women in Democracy, said:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>Despite his pre-election pledge to make a third of his Ministerial list female, the prime minister is now running the country with a Cabinet that's almost 90% male.</p><p>The number of women in Cabinet is now at its lowest level since 1997, more than 15 years ago.</p><p>Just three women are now fully fledged members of the top table of politics – out of 22 ministers.</p><p>This mini reshuffle has taken us backwards not forwards when it comes to women's representation. We urge the prime minister to honour his pre-election pledge and ensure women's views, experiences and talent are respected at the top table of politics.</p></blockquote><p>Overall, the number of women in government has not changed as a result of the reshuffle.

Bew said:<br /></p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>In the public mind, if you don't have voting rights you're somehow not a full member and I do think there's a case for saying - and there's possibly also a case for saying there should be more lay members - there should be a debate here.

Leaders make mistakes when they are insufficiently challenged.</p><p>Eventually the restrictions and flummery of office must have an impact on how a leader sees the outside world. Cameron was, as opposition leader, able to travel around the country talking to people much more freely than he can now. This is not a personal criticism of Cameron, just an observation that all those filtered lines of people meeting and greeting the PM must after a while give a leader a very strange and unrealistic perspective.</p><p>I thought this when I heard that in Cameron's letter of thanks to Miller this morning he said that he hoped she would in time be back on the Tory frontbench.

While the cost is modest compared with the billions being spent on rail with HS2, the government funded plan to plug remote villages into the world wide web could arguably do more for the economy. But it has come under fire from Margaret Hodge's public accounts committee for handing all the contracts to BT, and from rural campaigners for delays and lack of ambition. Olympic games organiser Chris Townsend has been brought in to DCMS to turn things around, but he will need Javid's backing to ensure the government gets its money's worth from BT.</p><p>Javid, like his predecessor, will need to maintain a careful balancing act between policing and enfranchising the web. Under Miller, broadband providers agreed to offer all new customers the choice of using a filter for pornography and other unsavoury content. Miller also acted on child pornography, but there has been talk, from David Cameron himself, of action against websites publishing extremist content. Operating a blacklist of extremist material will not sit comfortably with broadband providers.</p><p>Further down the road, thoughts may turn to selecting a replacement for Ed Richards, chief executive of the influential media and telecoms regulator, Ofcom. A steady hand at the tiller for nearly eight years now, Richards looked ready to move on when he applied to run the BBC in 2012. Dame Patricia Hodgson took over from Colette Bowe as chairman of Ofcom in December, and Richards may decide to look for the next opportunity now that his board has a new leader.</p></blockquote> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-53454304e4b06807fd8c4ee6\" class=\"block is-summary\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-04-09T14:21:44.833+01:00\">2.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Lunchtime summary</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p><b><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/apr/09/cameron-defends-maria-miller-expenses-claims\">• David Cameron has offered cross-party talks on the future of regulation of MPs following the resignation of Maria Miller as culture secretary. </a></b>Speaking at PMQs, he said he understood that the public was still very angry about MPs' expenses.</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>The biggest lesson I learned is that that that anger is still very raw and it needs to be acted on.</p></blockquote><p><b>• Ed Miliband has said that Cameron's decision not to insist on Miller's resignation earlier was &quot;a terrible error of judgment&quot;. </b>Speaking at PMQs, Miliband said:<br /></p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>If it had happened in any other business, there would have been no question about her staying in her job.

That explains why David Cameron was able to see him off.</p><p>Miliband devoted all six of his questions to the Miller affair. He started with an open question about the lessons Cameron has learnt from the affair, but then he focused on attacking Cameron for his decision to support Miller after the report came out last week. Predictably, Cameron said Miliband himself was not calling for Miller to resign. Miliband had a smart reply:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>I’ve heard everything – it’s my job to fire members of his cabinet.</p></blockquote><p>But Cameron had a reasonable line of his own too.</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>I think it shows all the signs of someone seeing a political bandwagon and wanting to jump on it. You are jumping on this bandwagon after the whole circus has left town.</p></blockquote><p>He had a point - which is why the Miliband attack was brushed off rather easily.</p><p>Cameron was also better at sounding positive. Buried amongst the partisan banter was an offer to hold cross-party talks on the regulation of MPs and and a repeated insistence that this is a &quot;good and honest&quot; parliament. It remains to be seen whether this initiative gets anywhere. But even some Labour MPs may have been pleased to hear the prime ministers stand up for parliament as a whole. </p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-53453172e4b0e849576644e7\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-04-09T12:40:21.909+01:00\">12.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p><b>Andrea Leadsom</b> is being appointed to the Treasury to replace Nicky Morgan, according to Mark Garnier.</p> <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Mark4WyreForest/statuses/453850163715801088\"> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Absolutely fantastic news Andrea Leadsome is promoted to the Treasury.

And they are. But they also have the effect of &quot;lancing the boil&quot; and it won't necessarily be easy for Ed Miliband to exploit it at PMQs. He has three options. But they are all problematic.</p><p><b>1. Miliband could attack David Cameron for his handling of the Miller affair. </b>This was the line the party adopted in a statement it put out at 8.30am this morning. But if Labour thinks it is right for Miller to resign today, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2014/apr/08/maria-millers-expenses-controversy-latest-developments-politics-live-blog#block-5343d2cbe4b053db358db080\">why did Miliband not say Miller should resign when asked about this yesterday?</a> And the standards committee that effectively exonerated Miller is chaired by a Labour MPs. </p><p><b>2. Miliband could pass over the Miller case and focus on the wider need for reform of the system of self-regulation of MPs.</b> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/apr/09/david-cameron-maria-miller-expenses-row-wrong\">As Patrick Wintour reports</a>, Miliband knows that this is not just a partisan problem.</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>There are few in the Labour leader's office that think the misjudgments by Downing Street will leave them the beneficiary. The Miliband office was uncertain about whether to call for Miller resignation, not because they had any doubt she should go, but because they felt the only beneficiaries of the public anger were the anti-politicians.</p></blockquote><p>But it might be hard for Labour to demand reforms when the party does not have many proposals of its own to change the way standards are enforced at the Commons. (Labour is calling for the standards committee to lose its government majority, but it always agrees reports unanimously anyway, so it's hard to see how this would make much difference.)</p><p><b>3.

I think it's the right thing to do.</p></blockquote><p><b>• She rejected suggestions that she was being victimised by the media because of her support for a Leveson-backed royal charter on press regulation. </b>Asked if she was the victim of a witch hunt, she said:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>I take full responsibility for the situation. I fully accept the findings in the parliamentary standards report. This is about that. </p></blockquote><p><b>• She accepted that she had been in the wrong - but declined to elaborate. </b>This is what she said when asked if she accepted she had done something wrong.</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>I have made it clear, and apologised unreservedly to the House of Commons, and made sure that it was clear to everybody that I took full responsibility for those findings. </p></blockquote><p><b>• She said she was resigning because she did not want to be a distraction to the government. </b></p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>This has been a really difficult 16 month. Because I was cleared of the central allegation made about me by a Labour member of parliament I hoped that I could stay. And it has become clear to me over the last few days that this this has become an enormous distraction and it's not right that I'm distracting from the incredible achievements of this government.</p></blockquote><p><b>• She said she would continue to support her colleagues and &quot;above all the prime minister&quot;.</b></p><h2>Analysis</h2><p>I'm afraid it did not make a good impression. People are often inclined to be sympathetic to a minister who has resigned, but it was hard to empathise with Miller while watching that. Partly that was because she did no really engage with the questions; she just kept returning to her lines about taking full responsibility and not wanting to be a distraction. And partly it was because, again, she has failed to show any real contrition. Asked if she had done something wrong, she said that she had apologised, but she did not say for what and she did not address the point that almost everyone has made, which is that her apology sounded inadequate. And she said she accept the findings in the standard committee's report. But which ones? The parliamentary commissioner for standards' ones? Or the different, and much less severe, ones from the committee. On the Today programme this morning Michael Gove (who had his own difficulties with expenses) sounded like someone who fully appreciates the anger voters feel about this issue. On expenses, Gove now &quot;gets it&quot;. Miller still sounds like someone who doesn't.</p> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-04-09T10:48:50.375+01:00\">at 10.48am BST</time></p> </div> <div id=\"block-534510dee4b06807fd8c4e75\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-04-09T10:24:02.878+01:00\">10.24am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Maria Miller's interview</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Here's the Maria Miller interview.</p><p>It was a pooled interview with Sky's Sophy Ridge.</p><p><i>Q: Why did you decide to resign?</i></p><p>Miller says she hoped to stay.

Here's an excerpt.</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>The blame starts with the Prime Minister. He should need no telling about expenses scandals. Not so long ago, he dealt quickly and forcefully with Tory MPs who had been exposed by the <i>Daily Telegraph’s </i>investigation – in stark contrast with the stunned Gordon Brown. Now it seems it was Mr Cameron’s turn to see all this chiefly as a battle with the press, of resisting a witch-hunt, rather than as a simple matter of probity ...</p><p>Having chosen the fight, No10 seem to have had no plan for winning it. Normally, the drill is to line up Ministers and MPs who can go out to defend the embattled minister. No such arrangements were made. I’ve spoken to MPs who have been stunned at the sheer disorder in No10, the utter absence of a political operation of the ability to even guess how all this would play out. The Cabinet has been noticeable by its silence – aware of just how toxic it is to be seen defending someone found to have been on the hey-diddle-diddle. Normally, a Prime Minister either drops the minister or mounts a proper operation to defend the minister. In this case, neither happened.</p><p>Esther McVey, the welfare minister, was allowed to go on to ITV’s The Agenda and admit that she would not have fiddled her expenses – stoking the row further. Perhaps she was being mischievous. But it’s more likely that she alerted No10 about her position before going to the programme, and was not discouraged. Yet again, an abject failure of party management has been exposed.</p></blockquote> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5344ed71e4b0fbdb5833e09a\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-04-09T08:00:20.391+01:00\">8.00am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Here is some snap reaction to Maria Miller's resignation on Twitter from journalists and commentators.</p> <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JGForsyth/statuses/453781208695312384\"> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>So, the Maria Miller situation is resolved before PMQs</p>— James Forsyth (@JGForsyth) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JGForsyth/statuses/453781208695312384\">April 9, 2014</a></blockquote> </figure> <p>James is right.

I hope that you will be able to return to serving the Government on the Frontbench in due course, and am only sad that you are leaving the Government in these circumstances. </p><p>David Cameron</p></blockquote> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5344e98fe4b0e84957664466\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-04-09T07:33:32.446+01:00\">7.33am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Maria Miller resigns - Her letter to David Cameron</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Maria Miller, the culture secretary, has resigned.</p><p>Here's here letter to the prime minister.</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p> Dear Prime Minister, </p><p>It is with great regret that I have decided that I should tender my resignation as a member of the Cabinet. </p><p>I am very grateful to you for your personal support but it has become clear to me that the present situation has become a distraction from the vital work this Government is doing to turn our country around. </p><p>I have been a member of the Conservative Party for more than 30 years. As a working mother, educated at a South Wales comprehensive school, I know that it is our party that understands the importance of giving everyone the opportunity to succeed regardless of where they come from. </p><p>I am immensely proud of what my team have been able to achieve during my time in Government: ensuring that our arts and cultural institutions receive the rightful recognition that they deserve in making Britain Great; putting women front and centre of every aspect of DCMS's work; putting in place the legislation to enable all couples to have the opportunity to marry regardless of their sexuality. </p><p>Of course, implementing the recommendations made by Lord Justice Leveson on the future of media regulation, following the phone hacking scandals, would always be controversial for the press. Working together with you, I believe we struck the right balance between protecting the freedom of the press and ensuring fairness, particularly for victims of press intrusion to have a clear right of redress. </p><p>I will continue to support you and the work of the Government as you move forward. Ensuring the best future for the people of Basingstoke has been my priority throughout the last nine years. Whether on the front or back benches of the House of Commons I will continue this work. </p><p>The only reason I was able to become an MP and indeed a government minister and cabinet minister is because of the unstinting support of my husband, my mother, my father and my three children. I owe them all a great deal. </p><p>Maria Miller </p></blockquote> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-04-09T10:12:49.814+01:00\">at 10.12am BST</time></p> </div><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/434083524|2014-05-04T10:23:41Z|9ddd98d51cd929c52b606ea8b805cf6b863e73d5 -->",
