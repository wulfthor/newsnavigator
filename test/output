        "headline":"Manchester United's youth Premier League finalists emulating class of '92",
        "body":"<p>At Anfield on Friday night, Manchester United's latest band of hopefuls continued their quest to emulate the vaunted Class of 92. Warren Joyce's reserve team knocked Liverpool out of the Under-21 Premier League at the semi-final stage, winning 1-0, as they continued their attempt to retain the trophy they won last year.</p><p>To follow Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes, Nicky Butt, David Beckham and Phil and Gary Neville to become the driving force of the 20-times champions may be the impossible task but that is the challenge. Most will fall short. The wave of talent nurtured by Eric Harrison and given the chance to blossom by Sir Alex Ferguson may go down as the brightest group of home-raised youngsters in domestic football history.</p><p>United's move to have a B team playing in the Football League is driven by the club's belief that since Giggs et al the influx of foreign players has left homegrown footballers' hopes near to moribund. Twenty years ago English players made up 69% of first-team starting XIs. That has dropped to a paltry 32%.</p><p>Still, the cream can rise to the top. The path from reserves to first team has been cleared again by Adnan Januzaj, and James Wilson is the latest to push for promotion. Only 18, the striker was named as a substitute by David Moyes for United's 4-0 win at Newcastle last month.</p><p>Having also been in the squad against Aston Villa and for the visit of Bayern Munich, Wilson, who has 19 goals this term, wants a senior debut soon. \"Hopefully, it's not too far off. It would be great and it's what you work towards,\" he says. \"Every time I just think: 'I could be in that first team.' It would be great to get a few minutes on the pitch. I need to see how I deal with the atmosphere, the pressure and other factors.\"</p><p>Against Liverpool there were flashes of the pace that with his lethal finishing makes Wilson, who hails from Biddulph in Staffordshire, a prospect.</p><p>One memorable strike came against Charlton at Old Trafford in an FA Youth Cup quarter-final in 2012 while still a schoolboy. \"I can remember being in the changing rooms afterwards and I was in the shower,\" says Wilson, who at 5ft 11in is not the tallest of forwards. \"It was boiling hot and everyone was touching the water and asking how I could bear to stand in it. It must have been because of adrenaline. It was just a great feeling, particularly with it being the winner as well.\"</p><p>Louis van Gaal, the favourite to replace David Moyes permanently, favours young players because of their willingness to buy into his philosophy so the Dutchman will demand regular dispatches from Joyce on Wilson and his cohorts.</p><p>The son of a father whose sporting preference is snooker, Wilson believes his progress should inspire others. \"Yes, I think a few of the younger lads at my digs are asking things,\" he says. \"As a boy I used to look up to lads when I was their age. The roles are reversed now and I know what it's like to be in their situation.\"</p><p>Being in the matchday squad at St James' Park was a highlight. \"It was a great experience being with the team and learning how to act around the hotel by being professional,\" says Wilson. \"Even the warm-up was different –  out there with Nemanja Vidic and Tom Cleverley. When you're warming up for the reserves there are not usually thousands of people around. It was a great atmosphere – even when you're out there beforehand the ground is filling up and you can feel the volume rising.\"</p><p>Wilson and his team-mates defeated Liverpool courtesy of a blistering first-half 25-yard strike by Andreas Pereira to reach this month's final, where Chelsea await.</p><p>If having the chance to win consecutive titles is impressive for a side whose average age is 19-and a-half, there was still a troubling lack of quality on show to those watching, who included Scholes and Butt, plus the Liverpool manager, Brendan Rodgers, and Kenny Dalglish.</p><p>There was little of the fast-paced pass-and-move stuff United desire to ensure continuity in style from first team through the club's age groups. This, United say, is further evidence that Wilson and company should be parading their talents lower down the pyramid in high-pressure professional football.</p><p>At the moment, though, this prospect remains remote so the club's class of 2014 will have to try and make it the old-fashioned way.</p><p>Wilson hit a post early on but he was starved of clear opportunities in Joyce's 4-2-3-1 and limped off towards the end with yet another of the injuries that have plagued his campaign.</p><p>He says: \"I've finished growing and 5ft 11inches is going to be my height. Hopefully, there will be no more injuries. I fractured my ankle a few years ago at Southampton and that was a bad one. It was weird because I'd never been out for that amount of time. It was hard because I was in the gym every day and not out on the pitch with the lads. So I just knuckled down and got back fit as soon as possible.\"</p><p>Beyond Pereira, an 18-year-old Belgian who joined from PSV Eindhoven two years ago, Ben Pearson also impressed. The 19-year-old from Oldham patrolled midfield and might have doubled the scoring when bursting through after 68 minutes.</p><p>The 24-year-old goalkeeper, Ben Amos, and Guillermo Varela, 21, a Uruguayan defender who moved effortlessly into midfield during the win, also shone in what was a makeshift side.</p><p>Joyce said: \"We [had] a side out there with no centre-halves in. We've had no defenders – Paddy McNair came to the club as a No10, Charni Ekangamene is a midfield player. You've probably got two right-backs, one centre-forward and the rest are midfield players. So we have to work on certain things because of that. The lads did tremendously well to take on board everything we asked them to do – to keep a clean sheet. I think we've conceded less goals than everyone in the country despite having no defenders.</p><p>\"We're mindful of the fact that obviously we're trying to produce footballers and clever footballers, but also trying to produce good human beings – the character of Manchester United players. So that when they go out on loan they are dependable and reliable.\"</p><p>For Wilson and company the dream is to force Van Gaal or whoever takes over from Giggs, who is the interim manager, into selection for the summer tour. \"Hopefully all being well I'll have no injuries and will get on that plane to America. It would be absolutely brilliant. I've been to the States before, in the Dallas Cup last year.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/435977051|2014-05-04T13:19:43Z|b351a29ed29540ed67a4b011d818b334483a2b19 -->",

He would not accept a token position similar to the one Moyes offered.</p><p>Danny Blind, Van Gaal's No2 with Holland, is not expected to follow him to Old Trafford as he has longer to run on his contract with the Dutch football association. Although Patrick Kluivert, another of Van Gaal's Holland staff, is set to join him at United, it would be a surprise if the former Ajax and Barcelona striker was made assistant manager as he has never undertaken that role.</p><p>With Giggs keeping his options open – including considering playing on for one more year with an extension on his current deal – it is thought he would seriously consider accepting the No2 position if Van Gaal were to ask him.</p><p>On Friday Giggs, who has played for United for 23 seasons, hinted he would not be afraid to leave the club, saying: \"I&nbsp;have got to decide if I want to play or not, so there is no point thinking if I want to be an assistant or if I want to be a manager somewhere else.\"</p><p>After the defeat to Sunderland Giggs suggested he is being kept informed about off-field matters, with the 40-year-old stating he would offer input if consulted by Ed Woodward, the club's executive vice-chairman.</p><p>\"I will concentrate on Tuesday night [when Manchester United host Hull] and if Ed or the board want to ask my opinion or advice on anything then I am willing to give it,\" he said.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/435987177|2014-05-04T13:19:43Z|0871ae7874e3b502db81394f2b09ed73a6f7983c -->",

The frustration and worry is about next season now - we have lost our best player with no replacement plan despite much warning, our only goalscorer is on loan and won't return next season and our most creative player is being ostracised. Never mind not winning trophies - there is zero ambition being shown even to try in those competitions. Our team is far worse than at the start of the season.

Reading host Promised Land bound Burnley needing a win to secure the final playoff spot, alongside Derby, QPR and Wigan. Should they slip up, Brighton can make off with their spot - providing they can better the Royal's result at Nottingham Forest. Blackburn are also in with an admittedly faint shout - if they win, the others lose, and they conjure a seven goal swing by thrashing Wigan, they can still clamber in.</p><p><br /> Barnsley and Yeovil are down, but there's still one place to fill in the pod before it's jettisoned into the netherworld of League 1. Lee Clark's Birmingham, winners of a mighty TWO home league games thus far, are in the hot seat - but a draw at Bolton could haul them clear, if Doncaster lose at Leicester. The Foxes, incidentally, can break the 100 point barrier with a draw.

It could also be the day that Fulham's thirteen season shift in the Premier League comes to an end; Cardiff's less impressive one season run is also at risk. <br /></p><p>Both teams have struggled valiantly to put a survival run together, and will continue the fitful fight at Stoke and Newcastle respectively this afternoon. Fail to win, and they'll have to hope that plucky Man United can hold Sunderland to a draw at Old Trafford, or they're toast. The resurgent Black Cats still have home games to come against West Brom and Swansea - realistically, it's win or bust for Messrs Magath and Solskjaer. </p><p>One team who can all but secure their survival today are Aston Villa - they host Hull, and will cruise to a surely unassailable 38 points with victory. The only slight concern is that Villa currently look like they'd labour to a draw against a set of training cones. Other teams' inadequacies may save them in the end regardless, but with games at the Etihad and White Hart Lane to come, Paul Lambert's lot will be desperate to take matters into their own hands.</p><p>The full 3pm Premier League line-up:</p><p><b>Aston Villa v Hull City</b></p><p><b>Manchester United v Sunderland</b></p><p><b>Newcastle v Cardiff City</b></p><p><b>Stoke City v Fulham</b></p><p><b>Swansea City v Southampton</b></p><p>There's also plenty of business to attend to in Leagues 1 &amp; 2 - there are two third-tier relegation places to be filled, with <b>Carlisle, Tranmere, Notts County,</b> <b>Crewe </b>and (mathemetically) <b>Colchester </b>still in peril. In League Two, <b>Wycombe </b>will join today's opponents Torquay in non-league next year, unless they win and either <b>Northampton </b>or <b>Bristol Rovers </b>lose. The title is also up for grabs, with all three already promoted sides capable of lifting the trophy - <b>Chesterfield </b>will take it with a home win against Fleetwood, with <b>Rochdale </b>and <b>Scunthorpe</b> waiting, should they fall on their faces.<br /></p><p>We're focusing on all things Championship for the time being, with the second tier's final twelve games all kicking off at the ungodly hour of 12.15pm.

Plodding, impotent and characterless: these type of pejoratives were supposedly banished in Ryan Giggs's brave new Manchester United world.</p><p>Instead, the old quality deficit again glared. Only when Danny Welbeck was introduced in the closing part of the contest did the champions regain some kind of potency via his willingness to take the fight to Sunderland.</p><p>Giggs said: \"It was just that lack of quality in the final third, and a lack of concentration. I still believe there is quality in the dressing room. We have shown good form away from home but at Old Trafford it seems to have been a problem. In past seasons there would be waves and waves of shots and saves and you could always sense a goal was coming, but this season it doesn't seem to have happened.\"</p><p>For Gus Poyet's side, this fine result followed the draw at Manchester City, and wins over Chelsea and Cardiff City.</p><p>If Norwich City lose at Stamford Bridge on Sunday then Sunderland's three-point advantage with a match in hand, should be enough to consign the Canaries to relegation, due to the Black Cats' goal difference, which is 13 better than that of Norwich.</p><p>Poyet said: \"I am feeling great. We could have a hand from Chelsea. We need to concentrate on what we do. What we have done in the last four games is unique, incredible. A miracle was the word I used a few weeks ago and apparently every now and again it happens.\"</p><p>The first goal conceded by United in the Giggs era came from the boot of Sebastian Larsson. Connor Wickham continued to make a case for being the division's in-form player with a slick pirouette and cross from the right that went precisely at the Swede. Allowed too much room by the home defence – and Michael Carrick, in particular – Sunderland's No7 planted the volley expertly beyond David de Gea.</p><p>This had Poyet clenching his fist in jubilation and Giggs walking back to his seat in frustration. There would be further food for the Welshman's half-time thoughts. Instead of a United fightback the visitors dominated the remainder of the stanza. Adam Johnson was the next recipient of United kindness when the winger found himself in the area with ball at feet and no defender close. Only his own clumsy control ended the threat.</p><p>Immediately after Larsson's goal Giggs had told Robin van Persie and Marouane Fellaini to warm up. Yet when United emerged for the second half the lineup remained the same.</p><p>The second side chosen by Giggs had shown five changes from his first. Out went Welbeck, Shinji Kagawa, Tom Cleverley, Wayne Rooney and Antonio Valencia and in came Ashley Young, Javier Hernández, Juan Mata, Darren Fletcher and Nani.</p><p>Wayne Rooney's twin maladies of stomach complaint and a troublesome groin kept him out, though his manager claimed he would be fine for England's World Cup campaign.</p><p>United almost equalised when Nani's backheel put Patrice Evra clear along the left. His delivery found Hernández but the close-range attempt deflected off Wes Brown for a corner.</p><p>From this Nemanja Vidic believed he had won a penalty when his header hit Brown but Howard Webb turned the appeal down.</p><p>Until Sunderland's opener, poise had been a fair description of what United showed. There was discernible control and pattern to their play, though scant goal attempts.</p><p>One breathtaking break did occur, on 19 minutes. Young burst down the right before switching play to Nani on the left. The Portuguese skipped towards Vito Mannone's goal and after offloading the ball it eventually found its way back and his ensuing shot threatened to beat the goalkeeper before curling wide.</p><p>As the match threatened to meander away from United, Giggs finally introduced Van Persie, for a first appearance due to a knee injury since 19 March, and Welbeck, on 66 minutes. Further embarrassment for United nearly occurred when the substitute Emanuele Giaccherini hit the post, and close to the end Fabio Borini smacked the ball on to the bar.</p><p>Before kick-off Giggs had signalled that despite the club's pursuit of Louis van Gaal, his role as temporary manager was starting to feel natural. \"My first week as interim manager, I must say, took me totally out of my comfort zone, but I didn't really have time to think about anything,\" he wrote.</p><p>\"But then, when I came in on Monday morning, it was as if everything had changed. I came into the training ground and just felt totally comfortable in the role. I'm enjoying it more and more each day. I've had a lot more time to think and everything has felt much more settled.\"</p><p>This defeat, though, is hardly a good calling card for the main job.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/435975159|2014-05-04T13:19:43Z|a2a35104989ca0c68d512ac13c5243a450147efa -->",

        "headline":"Manchester United's Ryan Giggs hails Louis van Gaal's 'fantastic pedigree'",
        "body":"<p>Ryan Giggs has admitted that Louis van Gaal, the favourite to become Manchester United's new manager, has a \"fantastic pedigree\" after winning the league in three different countries and that his own future may lie away from Old Trafford.</p><p>Giggs, who takes charge of a second match as interim manager for Saturday's visit of Sunderland, is aware that Van Gaal has been a success when managing Ajax and AZ Alkmaar in his homeland, Barcelona in Spain, and with Bayern Munich in Germany. The 62-year-old has claimed championships with all four clubs, plus the Champions League and Uefa Cup when at Ajax.</p><p>Talking about Van Gaal's abilities for the first time since the Dutchman was linked with United, Giggs said: \"He's got a brilliant reputation and is a successful manager in different countries. He's taken Holland to the World Cup. Yes, he's got fantastic pedigree.\"</p><p>Giggs has so far impressed in the caretaker role, leading United to last Saturday's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/26/manchester-united-norwich-city-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">4-0 win over Norwich City</a> at Old Trafford. While it is understood the Welshman would like to be considered for the permanent position his chances remain remote, with the club's hierarchy targeting Van Gaal.</p><p>Giggs hinted he would consider leaving United to become a manager of another club \"somewhere else\", though the Welshman insisted any decision over his future will be at the end of the campaign.</p><p>Asked if he would want to be No2 to Van Gaal or any new manager, the 40-year-old said: \"I have got to decide if I want to play or not so there is no point thinking if I want to be an assistant or if I want to be a manager somewhere else.</p><p>\"There are so many things to think about. The way I am thinking is I am <sup></sup>enjoying it and then my concentration is on the remaining two games and then, like I have just said, we will see what happens at the end of the season.\"</p><p>Giggs insisted he is just getting on with being the interim manager, having spent the week discussing youth player contracts and the club's summer tour.</p><p>\"Nothing has changed. We'll chat when the season's over,\" he said. \"I've got a lot to think about, whether to carry on playing. But my concentration is just on managing United now. The only peace and quiet you do get is when you are on the training pitch. As soon as you're back in the office, you have meetings, you have calls.</p><p>\"For example this week has been planning pre-season, which has been testing because we have to wait and see about the Europa League and the qualifying round three, for that is around about the tour time, so there are different permutations. Also, it is a difficult time for young players, extending and renewing contracts, loan players, players that need to come back, players that need their futures sorting out, so there has been a lot of that this week.\"</p><p>Wayne Rooney is a doubt to face Sunderland as he has a stomach bug and \"tight groin\", with the other players in the United camp, including the goalkeeper, Anders Lindegaard, also suffering from the digestive complaint.</p><p>Giggs said: \"A few of the lads have had a bug. Anders and Wayne have both had a bug. Wayne's also got a tight groin. And obviously with a bug you have to be careful with that because of the immune system being down a bit. Wayne being Wayne, he wants to play and be involved so we'll just monitor him over the next 24 hours.\"</p><p>Robin van Persie, who has not played since 19 March due to a knee injury, could again be in contention. \"Robin's looked good in training. Whether it is too early, we'll just see how he goes,\" said Giggs.</p><p>Rio Ferdinand and Patrice Evra, each of whom have contracts that expire at the close of the term, could leave. Yet their interim manager believes both have a future at the 20-times champions. \"I'd like them to stay on. It's their decision, their contracts are both up,\" said Giggs. \"They have both given massive service to the club and they are both fit, and looked good last week. I don't see why not.\"</p><p>Whose call would that be? \"It's everyone's decision – it's Rio's, it's Pat's and it's Ed's [Woodward, the executive vice-chairman] and whoever is the manager next year,\" he said. \"I think it is a group discussion but I still think they have got a lot to offer. They've been great players and remain assets to a club like Manchester United.\"</p><p>After Sunderland's visit, Hull City are the opponents in midweek for United's final home match this season. Has Giggs considered he might have made his last appearance at Old Trafford?</p><p>\"Again, it's not something I've thought about. We'll just have to wait and see. I'll have to see how the team performs and see if I can get in,\" he joked. \"My main priority is winning the games. Is me playing giving us the best chance? We'll see.\"</p><p>While Woodward has stated there could be an unprecedented investment in the squad this summer, Giggs believes there remain many good players at United.</p><p>\"What I do want to see is plenty of quality at the club,\" he said. \"Whether you have won a Premier League and been successful or you've not been successful, like this year, you always look to strengthen. That will never change. If the players are out there you try to get them. If there are players who can improve you and take you forward then you try to get them.\"</p><p>Giggs was asked whether he thought this would be the club's most important close season since he joined. \"No, I think every summer is important. After the treble-winning season in 1999 you ask: 'Where do you go from there?' The answer is you try to improve,\" he said. \"It's always important whether it's been a successful season or not. It's not been a great season this year. It's important we get the right players in and improve on this season.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/435928528|2014-05-04T13:19:43Z|6ae82a719d2904db19927bad645c95a7f9918ad5 -->",

        "body":"<p>Ryan Giggs has hinted he would consider leaving Manchester United to play or to become a manager of another club \"somewhere else\", though the Welshman insisted any decision over his future will come at the close of the campaign. Louis van Gaal is the favourite to become the permanent United No1, with the Holland manager hopeful of being appointed before 7 May when he begins official preparations for the summer's World Cup.</p><p></p><p>Asked if Giggs would want to be No2 to Van Gaal or any new manager, the 40-year-old said: \"I have got to decide if I want to play or not so there is no point thinking if I want to be an assistant or if I want to be a manager somewhere else. There are so many things to think about. The way I am thinking is I am enjoying it and then my concentration is on the remaining two games and then like I have just said, we will see what happens at the end of the season.\"</p><p></p><p>Giggs insisted he is just getting on with being the interim manager, with the Welshman having spent the week discussing youth player contracts and the club's summer tour. \"Nothing has changed – it's until the end of the season. We'll chat when that's over,\" he said.  \"I've got a lot to think about, whether to carry on playing. But my concentration is just on now. The only peace and quiet you do get is when you are on the training pitch. As soon as you are back in the office, you have meetings, you have calls.</p><p></p><p>\"For example this week has been planning pre-season, which has been testing because we have to way and see about the Europa League and the third qualifying round for that is round about the tour time, so different permutations. Also it is a difficult time for young players, extending contracts, renewing contracts, loan players, players that need to come back, players that need their future sorting out so there has been a lot of that this week.\"</p><p></p><p>Wayne Rooney is a doubt to face Sunderland as he has a stomach bug and \"tight groin\", with the other players in the United camp, including Anders Lindegaard, also suffering from the digestive complaint. Giggs said: \"He has a bug and a tight groin too. But Wayne being Wayne, he wants to play.\"</p><p></p><p>Robin van Persie, who has not played since 19 March because of a knee injury, could be in contention for Saturday's match. \"Robin's looked good in training. Whether tomorrow is too early, we'll just see how he goes today,\" said Giggs.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/435876162|2014-05-04T13:19:43Z|0ef351d5ef1b7181b1edeb53b0720bfcb2d1715b -->",

        "body":"<h2><p><b>1) Sunderland's survival special heads to Old Trafford</b></p></h2> <p>Despite heroic performances against Manchester City, Chelsea and Cardiff City that have yielded seven points out of a possible nine, their previous incompetence means Sunderland have done little more than give themselves a solid platform <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/25/sunderland-gus-poyet-relegation-fight\">from which to launch a successful fight against relegation</a>, whereas before they were neck-deep in quicksand. With home games against West Brom and Swansea City to come, it would be criminal if they failed to capitalise on their excellent work of the past fortnight, but first up it's Manchester United at Old Trafford, where Ryan Giggs will be attempting to make it <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/26/manchester-united-ryan-giggs-losing-sleep-norwich\">two wins out of two in his role as caretaker manager</a>. With Connor Wickham in the form of his life, having scored five goals in three games and created a couple more, it's difficult to see him not scoring tomorrow against a defence as ropy as that manning the barricades at Old Trafford. With Sunderland being Sunderland, it's difficult to see them going two games in a row without conceding at least once. Goals for both sides is the prediction, in a match that promises to be very entertaining and could well go either way. <b>BG</b></p><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/29/ryan-giggs-manchester-united-manager\"> Giggs to get United role whoever becomes manager</a><br /></li><li><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/25/sunderland-gus-poyet-relegation-fight\">Sunderland's Poyet prays for 'other half of the miracle'</a><br /></li><li><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/29/manchester-united-gary-neville-ryan-giggs\"> Neville calls for United to appoint a British manager</a><br /></li><li><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/apr/30/ryan-giggs-manchester-united-interim-manager\">Marina Hyde: Giggs as United boss? Suit you, sir!</a><br /></li></ul><h2>2) Will Sherwood deserve to be remembered with affection?</h2><p>This match doesn't matter much in the grand scheme of things but it is intriguing for the fact that it brings together two managers who seem to be loathed by large sections of their team's supporters. The reason for the antipathy of many West Ham fans towards Sam Allardyce is well known – <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/27/sam-allardyce-under-pressure-west-ham-fans-david-sullivan-no-vote-of-confidence\">they object to his style of football</a> – but the reason for the vitriol of many Spurs fans towards Tim Sherwood is less clear. Is it because they don't like the way the team has played under him even though they have scored more goals than under his predecessor and have won most of the matches they were expected to win? Is he just a patsy, the focus of fans' anger at a regime that fuelled great hopes but failed to back them up with a coherent plan? Or do fans just not like the way that Sherwood comes across in the media, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/25/tim-sherwood-tottenham-manager-win-record\">where he often accentuates his qualities</a> – which is understandable when everyone else is accentuating his shortcomings – and occasionally gives self-serving versions of events, a bit like every other manager? A mixture of all that, with added presumed guilt by association with Harry Redknapp? If he presides over victory at West Ham and then against Aston Villa on the last day, thereby ending the season with the same points tally as Andr&eacute; Villas-Boas collected last term, will Sherwood deserve to be remembered with any affection at White Hart Lane? <b>PD</b></p><ul><li> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/29/ronald-de-boer-tottenham-approach-ajax-manager\">De Boer keen for talks after Spurs approach Ajax</a><br /></li><li> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/27/tim-sherwood-tottenham-stoke-touts\">Sherwood not going quietly, tells job 'touts' to shut up</a><br /></li></ul><h2>3) Pardew and Solskjaer face prospect of more heat<br /></h2><p>When <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jan/04/newcastle-united-cardiff-city-fa-cup\">Cardiff won at St James' Park in the FA Cup</a> in Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's first match in charge, it was construed by some as a sign of imminent take-off by the Bluebirds. Instead it presaged a freefall by the Magpies. A few weeks laterin January <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jan/27/yohan-cabaye-paris-saint-germain-newcastle-united\">Newcastle sold their best player</a>, Yohan Cabaye, and carried on plummeting, while Cardiff spent those weeks recruiting lavishly, and also dropped. Solskjaer does not appear to know his best team or quite how he wants to play, while Alan Pardew seems to have run out of ideas of how to extract respectable performances from his side and seems to have given up completely <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/30/hatem-ben-arfa-newcastle-alan-pardew\">on the gifted Hatem Ben Arfa</a>.

City have won only once in their last 15 visits to Goodison Park but that's just a statistic that journalists blurt when they can't think of anything else to say; it will have about as much bearing on the outcome of this game as the alignment of the Giza pyramids with Orion. Far more significant is the fact that Everton can be a nifty and tenacious side and are still competing, in theory, for a top-four finish. Most significant of all, however, could be the absence from Everton's team of Gareth Barry <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2014/may/01/everton-roberto-martinez-loan-signings-parent-clubs-premier-league-video\">on the grounds of him being on loan from City</a>. Even if Sylvain Distin returns to the centre of defence to replace Antol&iacute;n Alcaraz, the void left by Barry risks giving Yaya Tour&eacute; and Samir Nasri even more scope for causing havoc.

So Samuel Eto'o could get a chance to go some small way to atoning for his costly blunder against Atl&eacute;tico Madrid. In fact, it is not inconceivable that Chelsea could win by a big enough margin to overhaul their goal difference deficit in the title race, just in case that becomes an issue. But do they think that will become an issue or do they accept that by losing in the Champions League they have blown their season? If Chelsea are not in the right frame of mind, Norwich might just inflict a third successive home defeat on Jos&eacute; Mourinho and bolster their own survival bid, two outcomes that seemed unthinkable a short while ago. <b>PD</b></p><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/may/01/oscar-chelsea-world-cup-injury-fears\">Oscar wary of risking World Cup with swift return</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/30/eden-hazard-frustrated-chelsea-atletico-champions-league\">Frustrated Hazard hopes Chelsea learn from mistakes</a><br /></li><li><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/may/01/chelsea-atletico-madrid-jose-mourinho\">Chelsea undone by Atl&eacute;tico touch of class, says Mourinho</a><br /></li></ul><h2>6) Baggies bid to earn their stripes … for now<br /></h2><p>It was claimed this week that West Bromwich Albion are to unveil a new jersey, <a href=\"http://www.expressandstar.com/sport/west-bromwich-albion-fc/2014/05/01/west-bromwich-albion-set-to-ditch-blue-and-white-stripes/\">with reports stating</a> that the club is to jettison its traditional white and dark stripes. Quite why the club would allow kit manufacturers to tamper so much with its identity is uncertain, but perhaps the Baggies feel the need to differentiate themselves more from Newcastle, with whom they have developed plenty in common, chiefly a concern to consistently do just enough to stay in the Premier League (whereas Arsenal's concern, of course, is to consistently do just enough to stay the Champions League places). The visitors could achieve their goal this weekend with a positive result at the Emirates, which is not entirely out of the question given St&eacute;phane Sessegnon's excellent recent form and the improved performance of Yussuf Mulumbu last week. <b>PD</b></p><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/may/01/alex-oxlade-chamberlain-arsenal-injury-arsene-wenger\"> Wenger: no timescale on Oxlade-Chamberlain's return</a><br /></li></ul><h2><b>7) Villa's future hangs in the balance</b></h2><p>In Leandro Bacuna, Jores Okore, Nicklas Helenius, Antonia Luna, Jed Steer and Libor Kozak, Paul Lambert brought in a half-dozen young, relatively unknown players last summer at a cost of &pound;17.2m. A reserve goalkeeper, Steer has yet to make a Premier League appearance for Villa, while bad injuries have curtailed the campaigns of Kozak and Okore. The remaining three purchases have made just 52 league appearances between them, with 32 of those accounted for by the young Dutch right-back Lambert signed from Groningen. Although relegation for Villa is unlikely, it remains a distinct possibility and the sooner they get the two or three points required to secure safety, the better for Paul Lambert, who will be able to focus on bringing in players with Premier League experience for next season. With visits to Manchester City and Tottenham Hotspur to come, failure to beat the FA Cup finalists Hull City in their final home game of the season this weekend will leave Villa in real peril. With their owner's plans up in the air and facing opponents who could be forgiven for taking their eye off the Premier League ball (but have shown no sign of doing so thus far), this is Villa's best chance to guarantee their Premier League future ahead of a summer of uncertainty ahead. Will they rise to the occasion or make it their seventh game on the bounce without a win? <b>BG</b></p><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/27/paul-lambert-aston-villa-swansea-city\">Lambert feels heat from Aston Villa fans </a><br /></li></ul><h2><b>8) The tiki-taka derby</b></h2><p>The only Premier League match this weekend in which neither team involved has anything other than pride to play for, you might expect this to be a fairly pedestrian affair. However, with Swansea City and Southampton currently first and second in the Premier League possession stats table, this is a huge opportunity for them to make fools of all those cynics who wrote off Pep Guardiola's philosophy as old hat in the wake of Bayern Munich's midweek reverse, by attempting to tiki-taka each other into submission. We're predicting a draw and not a particularly riveting one at that. <b>BG</b></p><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/may/01/the-question-is-this-the-end-for-tiki-taka-football\">Jonathan Wilson: is this the end for tiki-taka?</a></li></ul><h2><b>9) Fulham face fight for survival</b></h2><p>Having carelessly dropped two points against Hull City last weekend, defeat for Fulham at the hands of Stoke City will see them relegated to the Championship in the very unlikely event that Norwich City and Sunderland win their matches against Manchester United and Chelsea respectively. The Stoke Sentinel <a href=\"http://www.stokesentinel.co.uk/Stoke-City-Win-tickets-final-home-game-season-v/story-21035786-detail/story.html\">are currently running a competition</a> to win a pair of tickets for this match and unlike previous seasons, most neutrals would probably resist the urge to enquire if second prize is &quot;two pairs&quot; and actually consider them well worth winning. This match has the potential to be a real thriller in one of the best grounds in the Premier League, with home fans raucously cheering on a team vying to finish in the top half of the Premier League for the first time ever. A win would give Stoke their joint highest Premier League points tally with one match left to beat it and the air of optimism around the Potteries suggests there's little question that Mark Hughes's men, who have lost just one of their last seven at home will give anything but their best against Fulham. If Felix Magath is to maintain his side's unlikely survival bid, their hosts won't make it easy. <b>BG</b></p><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/25/fulham-felix-magath-relegation-fight-hull\">Magath stirs inner fire to boost relegation fight</a><br /></li></ul><h2>10) Liverpool prepared for Palace test</h2><p>Brendan Rodgers, in his immediate <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/27/liverpool-brendan-rodgers-chelsea-parking-two-buses\">irritation with the methods used by Mourinho at Anfield last week</a>, declared that at least playing Chelsea will have prepared Liverpool for the trip to Crystal Palace. Such an observation may have sounded like sour grapes after a defeat but it was true: because Palace, especially if Mile Jedinak protects his defence <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/who-scored-blog/2014/apr/29/pfa-team-year-premier-league-liga-bundesliga-best-11s\">as expertly as he has done for most of the season</a>, can be just as disciplined and defiant as Chelsea. The question is whether Liverpool can be more inspired than they were last week? That could depend on several things: Daniel Sturridge being a week closer to full fitness should help; Steven Gerrard getting back to orchestrating play calmly rather than shooting every time he gets the ball in an attempt to make up for his infamous slip would also be a boon; and Glen Johnson discarding his strange habit of pausing every time he receives the ball and instead making vigorous efforts to get behind the opposing defence when he goes forward. The most welcome stimulant of all for Liverpool, of course, would be City dropping points at Everton. <b>PD</b></p><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/may/01/luis-suarez-liverpool-title-challenge-premier-league\"> Su&aacute;rez happy at Liverpool and focusing on title challenge</a><br /></li><li><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/apr/28/steven-gerrard-liverpool-chelsea-back-pass-mistake\">Ed Aarons: sorry to say it but Gerrard does have previous</a><br /></li></ul> <!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/435815568|2014-05-04T13:19:43Z|40a2f08ccd1ed7e7d55328382bf9dcbff2c7b970 -->",

        "headline":"Roberto Martínez raises the bar at Everton – but is it high enough?",
        "body":"<p>Manchester City players are queueing up to say Saturday's potentially decisive visit to Goodison cannot be taken for granted, with Everton needing a win to keep their slim top-four hopes alive, though a glance at the table and the fixture list suggests the chances of denying Arsenal a Champions League place moved from slim to malnourished after the calamitous defeats at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/16/everton-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Crystal Palace</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/26/southampton-everton-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Southampton</a>.</p><p>Four points ahead with two games to play, Arsenal need one win from West Bromwich Albion at home this Sunday or Norwich away a week later, while Everton will have to beat both City and Hull away and somehow hope the Gunners trip up twice against relegation-threatened opponents. Arsenal have put together three straight wins since the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/06/everton-arsenal-premier-league-report\" title=\"\">3-0 defeat at Goodison</a> that encouraged Everton to keep believing; Roberto Martínez's team have lost twice in the same period and too much ground has surely been lost.</p><p>With Aaron Ramsey back and Mesut Özil enjoying himself again, it is hard to see Arsenal letting this opportunity slip. They could put the issue to bed as early as Sunday lunchtime against a West Brom side who still need a point or two to be sure of safety but who have two easier fixtures (Sunderland and Stoke) to come after the Emirates.</p><p>Everton will know that, and though the atmosphere at Goodison should still be raucous and City will not be given anything as a present, that will have more to do with it being the final home game of a memorable season than the possibility of ending up in the Champions League. Other considerations to factor in to the equation are that Gareth Barry will have to sit out the game against his parent club, and the most likely beneficiaries of Everton denying City a victory would be Liverpool, who would then go to Crystal Palace on Monday with a chance of putting their title challenge back on track. So one way or the other it is bound to be an interesting day on Merseyside.</p><p>You would have to say, with nothing sorted out at the end of April except that Southampton are certain to finish eighth, that it has been a more than usually interesting season. Anything is still possible at the top of the table, where a mere three points separate the top three clubs, and the situation is just as fluid at the bottom, where there are only two points between the bottom four clubs and a win for any of them would have Aston Villa and West Brom looking anxiously over their shoulders.</p><p>All the top five clubs still have the same manager with which they started the season, while five of the bottom six have made changes, in Fulham's case multiple changes, though perhaps that only indicates that underperformance makes owners and chairmen nervous. Manchester United kept faith with an underperforming manager for most of the season, and look where that got them. Newcastle United too are currently a very poor advertisement for sticking with the same manager through thick and thin, yet even though Tottenham took a risk by replacing André Villas-Boas with the inexperienced Tim Sherwood, their league form and position has held up remarkably well.</p><p>Spurs' last two league games (away to West Ham, then home to Villa) appear more winnable than Everton's last two, so it is not inconceivable that Sherwood could still guide Spurs to a creditable fifth place. Not enough to keep his job, in all probability, with Spurs reportedly talking to Ajax's Frank de Boer, though an achievement that would put Martínez's \"fantastic\" season at Everton into a more sober perspective.</p><p>Martínez, before anyone else points it out, did not have £86m of Gareth Bale money to invest at the start of the season and had to do what he could instead with the cash received for Marouane Fellaini on the final day. He did not do too badly, buying James McCarthy from Wigan, bringing in Romelu Lukaku, Gerard Deulofeu and Barry on loan and successfully switching Everton on to a more possession-based game. It was not Martínez either who promised Champions League football, that was Bill Kenwright rather ill-advisedly revealing the contents of a private conversation and creating a rod for his new manager's back in his first season. Martínez probably could get Everton into the Champions League bracket eventually, but for the annoying habit other leading clubs have developed of ploughing tens of millions into the same project. If everyone could stand still for a couple of seasons, Everton might rise above fifth place based on the quality of their football and their manager's relentless positivity.</p><p>Unfortunately, football doesn't work quite like that, and the harsh reality is that should Everton miss out this season, with Manchester United nowhere, it may take them a while to get as close again. United will have a new manager next season, and by all accounts will be investing massively over summer. It might not have the desired effect – something similar was being mooted this time last year – but whether Ryan Giggs or Louis van Gaal is in charge it seems unlikely, given the transfer budget and targets being talked about, that United will finish as low as seventh again.</p><p>Arsenal, Liverpool and Tottenham will also be strengthening over the summer, perhaps not to the same extent but in all likelihood to a greater extent than Everton, and if Liverpool are to return to being a fixture in the top four it is hard to see how their neighbours can also squeeze in. Under present ownership and management Chelsea and Manchester City are unlikely to drop out of the Champions League elite, so that leaves Arsenal, Liverpool, Spurs and United battling with Everton for the remaining two places. This season, with United struggling, Spurs stuttering and Arsenal looking unconvincing much of the time, represented a rare opportunity for Everton, but how many times in the foreseeable future are those conditions likely to be repeated?</p><p>Yet while Everton still have a slim to malnourished chance of a top-four place this season it would be wrong to write them off, or underestimate the sense of adventure and belief Martínez has brought to Merseyside. It is typical of Everton's luck that when they finally found a manager who could do that, Liverpool found one too. Everton's performances home and away against Arsenal were probably the high points, given that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/dec/04/manchester-united-everton-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">the excitement of winning at Old Trafford</a> subsided slightly when it became clear that almost anyone could do it, though the league table can confirm that overall improvement this season has been real and not imagined.</p><p>Last season Everton finished in sixth place with 63 points. Right now they are fifth, on 69, with two games to play. Winning both those games might not be enough to take them into the Champions League, because Arsenal are four points ahead. But should Everton win them they would end up on 75 points, which is as many as Chelsea took to finish third last season.</p><p>Should Everton take four points from their next two games they would finish on 73, which was good enough to see Arsenal finish fourth last season. This season it might not be enough, the bar for Champions League qualification could be set as high as 79, but no one could possibly deny that Everton under Martínez have raised their own bar significantly. Small margins, Martínez is fond of saying, are what make the difference in football. Everton are close, yet not quite close enough. Small margins may continue to confound them for some time.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/435679514|2014-05-04T13:19:43Z|c70912663191bed084e3e94c0999421ea64e901c -->",

        "headline":"Ryan Giggs as Manchester United manager? Suit you, sir!",
        "body":"<p>\"This is no time for a novice,\" thundered the hapless Gordon Brown in 2008, with his very uttering of those words appearing to guarantee that thenceforth, it would be time for a novice. It still is, I'm afraid. Experts are wholly out of vogue. In fact, when historians come to consider this lamely anti-establishment period in British cultural history, they may care to slap a&nbsp;slogan on it along the lines of \"Cometh&nbsp;the amateur hour, cometh the man\".</p><p>Then again, many living through it might counter, what have experts done for us lately? Banking experts brought global capitalism to the brink of Armageddon, governing experts have engendered the greatest contempt for the political class in modern history, and the man chosen by the experts' expert to manage Manchester United has been shown the door after piloting the club to its worst Premier League points tally. It doesn't feel a total coincidence that just as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/feb/10/ukip-better-2009-european-elections-guardian-icm-poll\" title=\"\">Ukip is topping the polls for May's European elections</a>, there is apparently \"growing support\" for the untried Ryan Giggs being named Manchester United manager over such a football establishment figure as Louis van Gaal.</p><p>United's collapse in form has been spoken about so portentously this season that you'd think it were analogous to the collapse of trust in our most vital institutions, from the police to parliament, the media to banks. There is a much-discussed anti-establishment sentiment abroad, some of which has coalesced around pseudo-rebellious figures such as Nigel Farage, and some of which may encourage sections of fandom to imagine that a complete rookie is just the chap to pick up the pieces at United after the Moyes interregnum.</p><p>So then to Giggs – or Giggsy Wiggsy, as the prescient insta-nostalgia of Ron Manager always had it – who in the circumstances can be seen only as the Farage of the Premier League. And my apologies to Ryan for that.</p><p>But with the exception of the occupants of the average goldfish bowl, are there life forms more hard-wired for rosy-tinted short-termism than the sort of people who can watch a side of the combined cost of Manchester United beat a dire Norwich over an inoffensive 90 minutes at home and declare that the solution to United's problems is in situ? On reflection, that question feels unfair to goldfish. There are creatures swimming through small plastic castles every 15 seconds, and marvelling at their crenellations as if for the first time, who exhibit more worldly wisdom than such folk.</p><p>Surely United couldn't possibly backtrack and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/29/ryan-giggs-manchester-united-manager\" title=\"\">give Giggs the job</a>? Listen, the previous prime minister actually wanted to make GMTV's Fiona Phillips a health minister in the Lords, while the current one got retail sublebrity Philip Green – reported cost of 60th birthday party: £6m – to pen a report on government profligacy. In a world of celebrity tsars, where even governments lack the confidence not to go casting around for well-known faces in historically misguided attempts to appease the electorate, it is not 100% beyond the realms.</p><p>Working on the principle that an immediate Giggs elevation is just too outlandish, however, even the sceptics must accept that it is perfectly possible for his mandatory presence at the club next season to put the kibosh on more experience-based appointments United may wish to make. Already, there are reports that a Van Gaal deal is sticking on the club's insistence on a role for Giggs, while people within the Giggs camp – have they even got the tent up yet? – appear to be briefing that he has a \"strengthening belief\" that he could be the right man for the job.</p><p>Still, never underestimate the importance of the suit round in the competition to assess managerial suitability. Like its evening-wear equivalent in the Miss World pageant, there is a strongly held perception that you just can't win the thing without it. Bearing this in mind, we should all be glad to add our voices to the chorus of experts whose analysis of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/26/manchester-united-norwich-city-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Saturday's action from Old Trafford</a> was effectively an observation that Giggs looked just right in his outfit choice.</p><p>Didn't he, though? Giggsy Wiggsy. Got it all, hasn't he? Lapels, buttons, pockets, sleeves, perfectly calibrated inside-leg measurement. Wears the club suit like it was made for him, isn't it? Probably is. And why not? Wonderful …</p><p>If you are one of those people who imagined that looking the part ceased to be a consideration in any sport with the publication of <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780393338393\" title=\"\">Moneyball</a> more than 10 years ago, you are strongly urged to have a word with yourself.</p><p>Admittedly, Michael Lewis's bestseller showed how the Oakland Athletics baseball team's management had successfully overturned decades of intuitive scouting via their reliance on strange, newfangled things that would come to be known as \"evidence\" and \"readily available statistics\". Players were not signed on the basis of what some hopelessly romantic scout could imagine them doing in his mind's eye, or on the basis that they \"looked like a ballplayer\".</p><p>Unfortunately, the sheer volume of comments on Giggs already \"looking like a manager\" indicates that some Premier League observers lag behind this sabermetric revolution. It's hard to be sure that they're precisely the same people who still believe a bloody-bandaged Terry Butcher epitomises what a passionate, committed England footballer ought to look like, instead of the pampered mini-moguls who don't seem to fancy it these days. But you wouldn't rule it out.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/435667483|2014-05-04T13:19:43Z|00c5cffb121d845b8a4e4d830eb7d861f2883086 -->",

Although he won the first game, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/26/manchester-united-norwich-city-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">4-0 against Norwich at Old Trafford on Saturday</a>, the club want a manager with a proven record of securing titles at elite European clubs and has vast experience of dealing with top-class players.</p><p>It is only in this category that the club executive believe Giggs falls short, and he himself concurs. United are intent, though, that he should remain as central to the 20-times champions as they move forward, whatever the new full-time manager decides. Van Gaal fits the club's required profile, though United continue to keep their options open, with Real Madrid's Carlo Ancelotti remaining on the radar.</p><p>If Real were to be knocked out of the Champions League by Bayern Munich in Tuesday evening's semi-final second leg in Germany – the Italian's team have a 1-0 advantage from last week's first game – United believe Ancelotti's potential candicacy would become stronger, though he has ruled himself out of the job.</p><p>The permanent successor to Moyes will be under no pressure from United to retain Giggs or any of the so-called Class of 92 who are part of his coaching team – Paul Scholes, Nicky Butt and Phil Neville – in any first-team capacity. However, if Giggs is left without a role, he will be offered one lower down the club's coaching structure by United.</p><p>Giggs's one-year playing contract expires at the end of the season, and after the victory over Norwich he admitted any decision on his future was a conversation he would have only once the stint as caretaker-manager finishes.</p><p>Anders Lindegaard, United's second-choice goalkeeper, is backing Giggs to lead the team to a strong finish at the close of what has been a dismal defence of the Premier League title.</p><p>\"I think we could definitely gain something from doing that,\" the Dane said. \"In these last few games, we can put some markers down and have something to build upon next season.</p><p>\"It's a great opportunity to win back more confidence for the team and the fans. I think this situation to do it in is almost perfect.</p><p>\"We have someone guiding us like Ryan Giggs who everyone on the planet respects for what he has done in his football career. I must say he's been great and he has handled everything very professionally. He seems to have stepped in with a huge amount of authority and respect. He doesn't in any way seem overwhelmed. It's probably the most difficult management job on the planet right now and he's been doing great.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/435619049|2014-05-04T13:19:43Z|cf4deabd687080f68c798949b12ab8fb54fd6fd6 -->",

There is no hard and fast rule and until you appoint someone you haven't got a clue whether it's going to work or not.</p><p></p><p>\"From that point of view, people say Ryan's got no experience but then is Van Gaal going to work?

        "headline":"Manchester United's new manager will make final decision on transfers",
        "body":"<p>Manchester United will give their new permanent manager the final decision on transfers, which means the club could face another traumatic summer in the market if their first choice, Louis van Gaal, is given the role.</p><p>The 62-year-old is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/28/louis-van-gaal-manchester-united-world-cup-ryan-giggs\" title=\"\">hopeful that a deal to make him David Moyes' successor will be sealed this week</a>, with the Holland coach keen to do so before starting his World Cup preparations on 7 May.</p><p>United are intent on avoiding a repeat of last year when Moyes and Ed Woodward, the executive vice-chairman, oversaw a disastrous window during which the pursuit of Cesc Fábregas, Leighton Baines, Ander Herrera and Fábio Coentrão ended in failure. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/sep/02/manchester-united-everton-marouane-fellaini\" title=\"\">Marouane Fellaini arrived from Everton on the closing day for £27.5m</a>, £3.5m more than his buyout clause.</p><p>United are aiming for an overhaul of the squad. Yet even if Van Gaal was appointed in the next few days it would leave him almost no time to finalise targets before starting his World Cup buildup. As with most managers, his preference is to meet a player in person.</p><p>United believe they have done much work on the players who could arrive in the summer. However, this was done under Moyes' direction and Van Gaal is bound to have differing views.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/23/manchester-united-beat-chelsea-luke-shaw-transfer-david-moyes\" title=\"\">Southampton's Luke Shaw</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/15/manchester-united-offering-toni-kroos-260000-a-week\" title=\"\">Toni Kroos of Bayern Munich</a> and Paris Saint-Germain's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/23/manchester-united-edinson-cavani-cesc-fabregas\" title=\"\">Edinson Cavani</a> are three players whom United believe they can sign. Although Van Gaal may also want them, he and the Dutch Football Association have stated that from Wednesday week his only focus will be Holland and the World Cup. How Woodward would deal with any complications encountered in the pursuit of targets – or any other player identified by Van Gaal – during this period is unclear.</p><p>It could mean deals having to wait until after Holland's World Cup campaign, which, if Van Gaal oversees a successful tournament, may not be until mid-July. Given the travails of last summer, this is recognised by the club as hardly ideal.</p><p>Although Van Gaal's advisers deny terms have been agreed, there is optimism that negotiations can be concluded and that an announcement can be made, even as soon as before the weekend.</p><p>If Van Gaal is appointed he could bring Patrick Kluivert as part of his coaching staff but the former Newcastle United striker would not be his No2. This would allow Van Gaal to offer the role to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/22/ryan-giggs-manchester-united-manager-david-moyes\" title=\"\">Ryan Giggs, the interim manager</a>, although there would be no pressure from United to do so.</p><p>Giggs, who is in charge until the end of the season as player-manager, admits his future is yet to be decided. \"I think that's another conversation as well. I don't know what I'm doing about playing, I don't know what's going to happen. It's something that I'll think about and decide with the appropriate people after the season.\"</p><p>The futures of many United players will remain in the balance until the next manager arrives. These include Patrice Evra and Rio Ferdinand but the captain, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/05/manchester-united-nemanja-vidic-internazionale\" title=\"\">Nemanja Vidic, is definitely leaving</a>.</p><p>Phil Jones believes he has learned much from Vidic. \"It's just his all-round game,\" he said. \"From his communication to his passing to his tackling to his heading, he's got so many great attributes. You learn off him every day in training, even if he doesn't say anything, you just watch and learn. He's been a huge influence on my career at United and has really helped me along the way. I owe him a lot and I am grateful for everything he's done.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/435529955|2014-05-04T13:19:43Z|084e13e95fbcd2e1a727214d1d9883cf2aac3482 -->",

        "body":"<p>As a showbiz PR and king of the tabloid kiss-and-tell, Max Clifford is fond of telling how he keeps many more stories out of the papers than he puts in. But <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/apr/28/max-clifford-guilty-indecent-assault-teenage-girls\" title=\"\">one story he was unable to prevent was his own</a>.</p><p>Clifford, who turned 71 this month, is one of the most influential people in newspapers, despite never having worked in one since he trained as a journalist more than 50 years ago.</p><p>As well as his work for celebrity clients, who have ranged from the Beatles to Simon Cowell and everyone in between (OJ Simpson, Jade Goody, Mohamed Al Fayed), Clifford is the first port of call for people with a story to tell, or who find themselves at the centre of a tabloid storm.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-435512047'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Media/Pix/pictures/2013/4/8/1365439663227/Simon-Cowell-008.jpg' alt='Simon Cowell' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Simon Cowell courts the media. Photograph: Rex Features/Sipa USA</figcaption></figure><p>Britain's best-known publicist, Clifford has brought down cabinet ministers and Football Association bosses in the three decades since the story for which he will be remembered above all others: his 1986 Sun splash \"Freddie Starr Ate My Hamster.\"</p><p>The story, he later admitted to Lord Justice Leveson, was apocryphal.</p><p>Clifford set up his eponymous PR agency in 1970, aged 27, representing Frank Sinatra, Marlon Brando and Joe Cocker, having joined EMI in the early 1960s, where he claims he was given the job of promoting an unknown band called the Beatles.</p><p>\"I was 27 and learned pretty quickly that by using a celebrity you could get publicity for anything,\" he said.</p><p>Along with the big name clients such as Cowell, the X Factor producer and presenter whom he has represented since 2001, Clifford's name has also become synonymous with tabloid kiss-and-tells. He represented MP David Mellor's mistress, Antonia de Sancha, former Miss India and society escort Pamella Bordes, and Imogen Thomas, briefly famous for her alleged affair with footballer Ryan Giggs.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-435512044'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/12/15/1323955121773/Imogen-Thomas-009.jpg' alt='Imogen Thomas' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Imogen Thomas poses for photographers outside court.

Quizzed whether he made money out of the star, who was dying of cervical cancer, Clifford walked out of a BBC interview in 2009, saying he was very comfortable with what he had done for Goody.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-435512049'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Media/Pix/pictures/2011/9/23/1316791812193/Jade-Goodys-wedding-007.jpg' alt='Jade Goody's wedding' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Jade Goody lived her last seven months in the media glare.

Diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2007, has said he had no intention of retiring.</p><p>\"I'll go on for as long as I can. I love it,\" he has said. \"This is not a career.

        "body":"<p>While speed rarely seemed to be of the essence at Manchester United under David Moyes on or off the field, indecisive dithering will not be tolerated under the incoming <strong>Louis van Gaal</strong> regime. According to the Mirror, the Dutchman could ink a three-year deal worth £25m as early as this week, because he wishes to get his contract talks done and dusted in order to concentrate on overseeing Holland's World Cup campaign.</p><p>Although he is expected to offer a backroom role to current caretaker manager Ryan Giggs, once in place at Old Trafford, Van Gaal is expected to bring in his own backroom team in a state of affairs that could well herald a welcome return to England for handsome nightclub enthusiast and the former Newcastle striker <strong>Patrick Kluivert</strong>, as well as the cultured former Dutch defender <strong>Danny Blind</strong>.</p><p>The Bayern Munich midfielder Toni Kroos and deep-lying Roma enforcer <strong>Kevin Strootman</strong>, who is currently sidelined with a knee injury that means he won't be joining Van Gaal and his Dutch team-mates in Brazil, both feature on Manchester United's summer shopping list, while the Schalke left-back <strong>Sead Kolasinac </strong>has also confirmed that United are attempting to sign him up, but told Dnevni Avaz, a newspaper in his native Bosnia, that he \"will not hurry with the decision\" because \"I have to see what Schalke think about it\".</p><p>Liverpool will attempt to make up for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/27/liverpool-chelsea-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">the crushing disappointment of yesterday's defeat at the hands of Chelsea</a> by plundering Bayern Leverkusen midfielder <strong>Emre Can</strong>,  21, and his speedy South Korean team-mate <strong>Heung-min Son</strong>, 20, who plays up front and is renowned for his versatility. A total of £24m is the fee being mentioned in conjunction with the pair. Liverpool are also interested in the 22-year-old Lyon striker <strong>Alexandre Lacazette</strong>, who is also getting the glad eye from Juventus and Arsenal. The Express reports that the Merseyside club will also try to sign scurrying South American striker <strong>Carlos Tevez</strong> from Juventus if they lose scurrying their South American striker and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/28/luis-suarez-liverpool-pfa-player-of-year-award\" title=\"\">PFA player of the year <strong>Luis Suárez</strong></a> to another club during the summer.</p><p>Newcastle will attempt to make up for the crushing disappointment of this evening's defeat at the hands of Arsenal by plundering wonder goal-scoring Swansea City midfielder <strong>Jonjo Shelvey </strong>from the Liberty Stadium, while Paul Ince is reported to be locked in negotiations with suits from Greek champions Olympiakos about a possible summer move to Athens for his son <strong>Tom</strong>, who is currently on loan at Crystal Palace from Blackpool.</p><p>Fenerbahce won the Turkish league title in unusual circumstances on Sunday, playing in front of a crowd made up of 50,000 women and children after all adult male supporters were banned from their game against Caykur Rizespor as a result of crowd trouble in a previous match. The controversial Istanbul side are now being linked with the Arsenal right-back <strong>Bacary Sagna</strong>, who will be offered a wallet-busting £100,000 per week, a stipend that would make him very Bosphorus indeed.</p><p>West Ham fans have had enough of seeing their team managed by <strong>Sam Allardyce</strong>, prompting club co-owner David Sullivan to inform them that the situation will be discussed during the summer. Among the club's ranks of players, the midfielder <strong>Mohamed Diamé</strong> has denied that he wants to leave the club, despite interest from Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur. Diamé's team-mate <strong>Joe Cole</strong>, whose contract expires this summer, is believed to be on the radar of the Ligue 1 side Lille, with whom he enjoyed a fairly successful loan spell during his wilderness years at Liverpool.</p><p>And finally, the Newcastle Chronicle reports that Chelsea are prepared to offer <strong>Demba Ba</strong> back to Newcastle, while the Daily Star claims they're ready to offer Everton £20m for their teenage central defender <strong>John Stones</strong>.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/435473239|2014-05-04T13:19:43Z|09fd58375872f4afe0a4a90f282d19b51b1d7131 -->",

        "body":"<h2>1) Mourinho strikes a balance</h2><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/apr/27/liverpool-chelsea-mourinho-simply-football\" title=\"\">A lot has been said about Chelsea's tactics</a> - much of it by Brendan Rodgers - but there are a couple of things that seemed to have passed under the radar. The first is that José Mourinho does not always set up his team to play this drearily. He is not the bore extraordinaire that a lot of people would like to make out. Or maybe we imagined all those goal-fests for Real Madrid and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/22/chelsea-arsenal-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">the six-goal thrashing of Arsenal</a>. What he does is devise system to win football matches and, if necessary, he will sacrifice aesthetic qualities when the opposition looks faster and more skilful. And that, plainly, was the risk when he was fielding his support cast against a Liverpool side, at Anfield, on a run of 11 straight wins, and with the volume turned high. Ugly? Yes. Hypocritical? Undoubtedly (just look at his comments <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jan/29/chelsea-west-ham-united-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">when West Ham played this way at Stamford Bridge</a>). Effective? Almost always. The other point is that Brendan Rodgers was wrong when he pointed out it was not difficult to coach that way. No other side in Europe defends as well in big matches as Chelsea, and it is not a fluke. It is a triumph of organisation, structure and competitive courage and if Chelsea can bring in a decent striker or two in the summer it should make them a formidable team next season. Defending is just as much a part of this sport as attacking and Liverpool would be in a more commanding position if they had found a better balance in this match. <strong>Daniel Taylor</strong></p><blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/27/liverpool-chelsea-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">• Match report: Chelsea 0-2 Liverpool</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/27/liverpool-brendan-rodgers-chelsea-parking-two-buses\" title=\"\">• Rodgers accuses Mourinho of 'parking two buses'</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/gallery/2014/apr/27/premier-league-liverpool-chelsea-in-pictures\" title=\"\">• Pictures: Tom Jenkins's images from Anfield</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/apr/27/liverpool-chelsea-five-things-learned-premier-league\" title=\"\">• Andy Hunter: five things we learned from the game</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/apr/27/brendan-rodgers-learns-not-to-underestimate-jose-mourinhos-caution\" title=\"\">• Michael Cox: Rodgers learns a lesson</a></p></blockquote><video data-media-id=\"gu-video-435476545\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">\n        <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/04/28/140428Chelsea-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/04/28/140428Chelsea_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/04/28/140428Chelsea_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/04/28/140428Chelsea/140428Chelsea.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/04/28//140428Chelsea.webm\"></source>\n      </video><h2>2) This always was City's title to claim</h2><p>Manchester City had done their best to inject intrigue into the title race, even while Liverpool's had been perceived as the more romantic pursuit and Chelsea's has been laced with their manager's charisma, but they now appear on the verge of confirming what everyone had suspected all along. Theirs has always been the strongest squad, their team crammed with players bolstered by the experience of winning the title in 2012 and scarred by their inability to retain it last term. They had actually built last summer from a position of strength, despite last season's toils and a change in manager. Mourinho has consistently painted them as favourites and now, if they win their last three games, he will be proved right. Those points shed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/13/liverpool-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">at Anfield</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/16/manchester-city-sunderland-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">to Sunderland earlier this month</a>, results which had given the other challengers such hope, may not count for anything if Yaya Touré rampages through the closing weeks of the campaign, David Silva returns to fitness and Sergio Agüero retains his, and Edin Dzeko maintains his recent scoring form. The title race has been intriguing, the charge led by Arsenal and Chelsea for long periods, and more recently Liverpool at a canter, but City, with their games in hand and menace on the shoulder, have just been waiting to pounce. Their time may now have come. <strong>Dominic Fifield</strong></p><blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/27/premier-league-crystal-palace-manchester-city\" title=\"\">• Match report: Crystal Palace 0-2 Man City</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/27/manuel-pellegrini-manchester-city-crystal-palace\" title=\"\">• Pellegrini: league title is in our hands now</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/apr/27/yaya-toure-key-man-title-manchester-city-liverpool\" title=\"\">• James Riach: Touré is key as City take control</a></p></blockquote><h2>3) Hats off to Bruce for signing Wickham for Sunderland</h2><p>This reporter has serious reservations about Steve Bruce (and the feeling is most definitely mutual!) but as Sir Bobby Robson used to say football, and life, is all shades of grey. So immense credit where it's due. When, as the then Sunderland manager, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/jun/29/sunderland-ipswich-teenager-connor-wickham\" title=\"\">Bruce paid Ipswich £8.1m for Wickham</a> three years ago, everyone accepted it was a medium term investment. Yet, understandably, when the England Under-21 striker scored one Premier League goal in three years, the suspicion was that the current Hull City manager had paid radically over the odds while making a horribly expensive mistake. Five superbly taken, sometimes technically very difficult, goals – two against Cardiff, one at Chelsea and at two at Manchester City – in under two weeks have revised such opinions. Dramatically. As a former centre-half, Bruce probably knows what he's saying when he claims teams are only as good as their strikers. Gus Poyet – whose decision to recall him from Elland Road was more than inspired – puts it: \"Connor has changed everything for us.\" Sometimes you really do – eventually – get what you pay for. And on that subject the recently hugely influential Emanuele Giaccherini will have proved worth the £8.7m Sunderland paid Juventus last summer should Sunderland complete Poyet's long prayed for, currently half completed, \"miracle.\" <strong>Louise Taylor</strong></p><blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/27/sunderland-gus-poyet-connor-wickham\" title=\"\">• Poyet: Wickham 'has changed everything'</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/27/sunderland-cardiff-city-premier-league\" title=\"\">• Match report: Sunderland 4-0 Cardiff</a></p></blockquote><h2>4) Kalas looks the part</h2><p>As gambles go, starting a 20-year-old defender who had just two appearances all season, both as an 89th-minute substitute, was a big one. This is especially true when you consider that Tomas Kalas would be facing the attacking abilities of Liverpool, the Premier League's top scorers and, bar Real Madrid, the top scorers in Europe's top five leagues. However the Czech international rose to the occasion and the demands of the game. He immediately formed a solid and effective partnership with Branislav Ivanovic and bar one miscued clearance, did not show any visible signs of nerves. He made two key interceptions on the left-hand side and successfully helped to clear a host of Liverpool attacks. A slightly stronger header moments before Gerrard's slip and he would have had a goal to go with his accomplished performance. <strong>Ian McCourt</strong></p><blockquote><video data-media-id=\"gu-video-435478342\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">\n        <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/04/28/140428Liverpool-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/04/28/140428Liverpool/140428Liverpool.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/04/28/140428Liverpool_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/04/28/140428Liverpool_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/04/28//140428Liverpool.webm\"></source>\n      </video><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/apr/27/liverpool-chelsea-mourinho-simply-football\" title=\"\">• Barney Ronay: not anti-football from Mourinho</a></p></blockquote><h2>5) Where does Fellaini go from here?</h2><video data-media-id=\"gu-video-435413066\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">\n        <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/04/27/140427Giggs-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/04/27//140427Giggs.webm\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/04/27/140427Giggs_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/04/27/140427Giggs_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/04/27/140427Giggs/140427Giggs.m3u8\"></source>\n      </video><p>Marouane Fellaini missed Manchester United's cathartic <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/27/manchester-united-ryan-giggs-norwich-city\" title=\"\">4-0 trouncing of Norwich City</a> on Saturday evening. The £27.5m signing was not deemed useful enough even for a place among his seven reserves by Ryan Giggs. The interim manager spoke about Fellaini's misfortune in this but, truthfully, it was a humiliation, especially given the well-documented quality deficit in central midfield at the club. The question now is where does the Belgian go from here? There seems only one answer. Expect surprise if he does not make an exit from United before the summer window is closed on 1 September to complete a pretty miserable year since he was signed by the ill-fated David Moyes. <strong>Jamie Jackson</strong></p><blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/27/manchester-united-ryan-giggs-norwich-city\" title=\"\">• Match report: Manchester United 4-0 Norwich City</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/27/rio-ferdinand-manchester-united-foreign-move\" title=\"\">• Ferdinand considers foreign move</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/apr/26/ryan-giggs-manchester-united-interim-manager\" title=\"\">• Jamie Jackson: Giggs brings back smiles</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/26/louis-van-gaal-frontrunner-manchester-united-holland-manager-carlo-ancelotti\" title=\"\">• Van Gaal frontrunner for United job</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/apr/26/louis-van-gaal-manchester-united-no-compromises\" title=\"\">• Jamie Jackson: Van Gaal is a manager of no compromise</a></p></blockquote><h2>6) Was Shelvey's strike really the goal of the season?</h2><p>Jonjo Shelvey's long range strike <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/27/paul-lambert-aston-villa-swansea-city\" title=\"\">for Swansea against Aston Villa</a> was heralded by some critics as a goal of the season contender, but even Garry Monk, the Swans' interim manager, was not sure about that. So what sort of goal is most deserving of such an accolade – a solo effort from improbable distance or the combined play typical of Arsenal, Southampton and Swansea? We are discussing a team game, so a personal preference is for the inter-passing kind, involving cohesive skills from several players and a tap-in finish. But football is a broad church, with room for anything that pleases its audience, and Shelvey's 47-yarder certainly merits serious consideration. <strong>Joe Lovejoy</strong></p><blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/27/paul-lambert-aston-villa-swansea-city\" title=\"\">• Match report: Swansea 4-1 Aston Villa</a></p></blockquote><h2>7) Could Clyne be England's answer at right-back? </h2><video data-media-id=\"gu-video-435325572\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">\n        <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/04/25/140425south-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/04/25/140425south_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/04/25/140425south/140425south.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/04/25//140425south.webm\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/04/25/140425south_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source>\n      </video><p>Roy Hodgson might as well have a season-ticket at Southampton these days. The England manager was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/27/roberto-martinez-drips-positivity-after-everton-implosion\" title=\"\">at St Mary's again on Saturday</a>, casting his eye over Luke Shaw, Adam Lallana and Rickie Lambert, plus Everton's Leighton Baines and Ross Barkley, but it was the performance of Nathaniel Clyne that stood out the most. Southampton's right-back has had to battle the exciting Calum Chambers for a starting spot all season but he was excellent against the tricky but frustrating Gerard Deulofeu – diligent, committed, quick, strong in the tackle and always willing to get forward. Right-back is not a position where England are especially strong at the moment – could Clyne be the answer? <strong>Jacob Steinberg</strong></p><blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/27/roberto-martinez-drips-positivity-after-everton-implosion\" title=\"\">• Match report: Southampton 2-0 Everton</a></p></blockquote><h2>8) Fulham should take a leaf out of Hull's book</h2><p>It is not hard to figure out where Fulham have gone wrong this season but if the club do need more clues, then they could refer to what Hull have done right. Steve Bruce's shrewd management has been complemented by judicious backing from his chairman, Assem Allam. Hull invested wisely in the summer by bringing in the likes of Curtis Davies, Tom Huddlestone, Allen McGregor and (on loan) Jake Livermore, and did so again in January, signing Shane Long and Nikica Jelavic for a combined fee of around £13m while Fulham were splashing out £12m on Kostas Mitroglou. It was fitting that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/27/felix-magath-failings-fulham-hull-city-steve-bruce\" title=\"\">Long and Jelavic scored on Saturday</a> while Mitroglou was again mysteriously absent, Hugo Rodallega squandered two fine chances and Darren Bent trod on the ball when put clean through. It is not just up front where Fulham lack quality, of course: their three managers have deployed 38 players this season in a variety of formations as they desperately seek 11 who can form a unit that can both attack and defend effectively for 90 minutes. With two games left, the search goes on. <strong>Paul Doyle</strong></p><blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/27/felix-magath-failings-fulham-hull-city-steve-bruce\" title=\"\">• Match report: Fulham 2-2 Hull City</a></p></blockquote><h2>9) West Brom need to spend</h2><p>West Bromwich Albion are at a crossroads – Pepe Mel doesn't know if he will be manager next season and, even if he is, he can count up only 13 of the current players whom he expects to still be here come August. So many are out of contract, on loan or set to be moved on, Mel would be looking for 10 new players – and that's if he gets Jeremy Peace's vote of confidence. After making progress season on season since they were relegated in 2009 – promotion, 11th, tenth then eighth – this is the first downturn new supporters have experienced. Mel has been unable to integrate his new methods in such a short time, with a relegation battle to deal with, so if they do stay up – as they now look set to – Peace will have to admit he made a mistake in the middle of this season if he seeks a fifth new manager in as many years.</p><p>Whoever starts next season in charge, Peace must prepare to stick with him for a good couple of seasons at least. Otherwise, instability will creep in and the Baggies will revert to becoming a yo-yo club. They still know how to play high-quality football and the major difference between last season and this is the goal power of Romelu Lukaku. But much of the squad's backbone is ageing. So Peace and the West Brom board should recognise this and loosen the purse strings sufficiently to give next season's manager a chance of sustainable progress. <strong>Peter Lansley</strong></p><blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/27/sam-allardyce-under-pressure-west-ham-fans-david-sullivan-no-vote-of-confidence\" title=\"\">• Match report: West Brom 1-0 West Ham</a></p></blockquote><h2>10) Could Adebayor still face time on the naughty step?</h2><p>Emmanuel Adebayor could yet face retrospective action for the sixth-minute incident that floored Ryan Shawcross in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/27/tim-sherwood-tottenham-stoke-touts\" title=\"\">Tottenham's win at Stoke</a>. Although the referee, Andre Marriner, took action by awarding Stoke a free-kick, changes made by the Football Association this season allow acts of violent conduct to be revisited whether or not the official witnessed them first-hand. Video evidence showed contact made between Adebayor's elbow and Shawcross's face but the pictures were fairly inconclusive and proving intent in such circumstances would be difficult.</p><p>This season's changes – which cover \"acts of violent conduct that occur secondarily to a challenge for the ball\" and \"off-the-ball incidents where one or more match official did see the players coming together, but the match officials' view was such that none of them had the opportunity to make a decision on an act of misconduct that took place within that coming together\" – saw the Fulham defender <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/nov/06/sascha-reither-ban-stamp-adnan-januzaj-fulham\" title=\"\">Sascha Riether banned for three matches</a> for a stamp on Manchester United's Adnan Janujaz in November. <strong>Richard Gibson</strong></p><blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/27/tim-sherwood-tottenham-stoke-touts\" title=\"\">• Match report: Stoke City 0-1 Tottenham</a></p></blockquote><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/435439342|2014-05-04T13:19:43Z|f9ea7de44eb8013857ee19957b24886274fed381 -->",

United, meanwhile, have an option, expiring next month, to extend his one-year deal.</p><p>\"I'm going to continue playing,\" Ferdinand said. \"Whether it's here, I don't know. But I hope so.\"</p><p>With Louis van Gaal United's first choice to become permanent manager, after last week's sacking of David Moyes, whether Ferdinand's United career is continued will be the Holland coach's decision, if he is appointed.</p><p>Ferdinand, speaking for the first time since David Moyes's removal, added that players have to take some blame for the dismal campaign. \"It's embarrassing. You don't want to look at the league table and see where we are. We were saying [before] I've not looked at the league table for ages, but it's because you don't want to.\"</p><p>\"But that's down to us as players. We take responsibility for that as much as anyone else. We are where we are and we have to take some responsibility for that. We are not shirkers and we are not people who don't take responsibility. I don't think you get to where we have got to in our careers without taking responsibility and this is no different.\"</p><p>Robin van Persie has returned  to full training after a knee injury  and may be available for Saturday's visit of Sunderland. Giggs said:  \"He came back [on Friday], he trained well and just needs to work on his fitness now, so he looked great. We'll just have to wait and see how he goes this week.\"<strong>   </strong></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/435430279|2014-05-04T13:19:43Z|a349b1909c38344b606210be9bbf4507646cd0f3 -->",

This was further evidence that perhaps what was most impressive about the Welshman a week into his leadership of the club is how his thoughts on the game are articulated.</p><p>The feelgood factor and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/22/david-moyes-sacked-manchester-united\" title=\"\">release from the ill-received David Moyes</a> would always ensure players would rediscover their fizz again, as they did in this rout of a struggling Norwich City. Yet the lucid – and open – way Giggs spoke afterwards portrayed a 40-year-old with the requisite intelligence the best managers have. Asked how surreal it was to be in charge, he said: \"Yeah, it was strange. How many times do you get up? Do you sit in your seat? Like you guys asked [on Friday], what are you going to wear?</p><p>\"It's all things I'm not used to, even though I've played so many games for the club. Leaving players out, though, that was really tough.\"</p><p>Giggs chose a club suit and expensive shoes and looked slick. But when mentioning those dropped for his inaugural XI, Giggs touched upon a show of ruthlessness. Juan Mata, who has impressed in the No10 berth, was relegated to the bench, while Marouane Fellaini could not force himself into the match-day 18. That was £64.6m worth of Moyes's purchases informed they might not be good enough for Giggs.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-435460858'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/4/27/1398632611733/Ryan-Giggs-takes-his-seat-009.jpg' alt='Ryan Giggs takes his seat in the dugout for the first time for Manchester United v Norwich City.' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Ryan Giggs takes his seat in the dugout for the first time, for Manchester United's 4-0 home win over Norwich City. Photograph: Tom Jenkins</figcaption></figure><p>Too much can be read into only 90 minutes of management. Yet a golden touch was suggested when the interim manager introduced Mata as his opening substitution after an hour. Three minutes later the Spaniard scored the first of two goals, to go with a Wayne Rooney double either side of the break, the first goal under Giggs being a 41st-minute penalty.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/26/louis-van-gaal-frontrunner-manchester-united-holland-manager-carlo-ancelotti\" title=\"\">United want Louis van Gaal as their permanent manager</a>. Yet if results continue this way until the close of the season fans will surely demand Giggs. Again, a smooth response was offered. \"I'll deal with that, hopefully. If I have got four wins, I'll deal with it then,\" he said. \"But there's so many things and aspects to this job, I haven't really got time to look too far ahead.\"</p><p>The guidance from United is that Giggs ticks all boxes except the one marked \"experience\". He said: \"Yeah, that's right, I've said that. I'm outside my comfort zone and I've quickly had to do so many things that I've never done before but I've enjoyed it. It's been a challenge but I must say the players and the staff have been brilliant. I've had really good support.\"</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/26/alex-ferguson-ryan-giggs-manchester-united-manager\" title=\"\">Last week Ferguson said United should give the job to Giggs full time</a>. This, plus the unique experience acquired from being at United since boyhood, should surely count for something when the decision is made?</p><p>\"I don't know – I have obviously been at the club for a long time and I know the ins and outs of the club,\" said Giggs.</p><p>\"But, like I said, there's so many other things that come with the job that I never knew did, because I've never been in that position before. They all add up during the day and they all add up during the week and it's tough. It's a real tough job but one that I'm enjoying the challenge of and hopefully will continue enjoying until the end of the season.\"</p><p>Despite <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/05/manchester-united-nemanja-vidic-internazionale\" title=\"\">Nemanja Vidic's departure, then</a>, and the futures of Patrice Evra and Rio Ferdinand being in the balance, Giggs believes United can be contenders again.</p><p>\"Yeah, I'm confident that the players that are at the club can challenge next year,\" he said. \"Its going to be hard, obviously, because we've had a tough season and obviously the lads at Liverpool have improved and other teams around us have. But I'm confident we have got the players.\"</p><p>He is clear that the summer transfer window should be enough to close any quality gap to Manchester City, Chelsea and Liverpool.</p><p>\"We <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/apr/23/alex-ferguson-robin-van-persie-goal?guni=Article:in%20body%20link\" title=\"\">won the league last year</a>,\" said Giggs. \"The year before <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/may/13/manchester-city-qpr-premier-league\" title=\"\">we lost it on goal difference</a>, the year before that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/may/14/blackburn-rovers-manchester-united-premier-league\" title=\"\">we won it.</a> Liverpool: where did they come last year – seventh? Who would have said they'd be where they are this year? So a lot can change. We've certainly got the players, we've got everything in place to have a successful season next year.\"</p><p>His team's performance against Norwich had been, perhaps, a little better than under Moyes on occasion this term. Really, though, four matches may not be enough to make any serious judgments on Giggs's managerial acumen.</p><p>But they should provide an intriguing snapshot of how United would play under him in a full campaign. And we already know Giggs has located the hairdryer.</p><p><strong>Man of the match </strong>Wayne Rooney (Manchester United)</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/435421403|2014-05-04T13:19:43Z|acb7ee0abec1aa750ab10ac649eb6278b1d2e7f1 -->",

        "headline":"Why Manchester United's class of 92 are natural choice to hold the fort",
        "body":"<p>It was when Ben Turner, one of the directors who helped make <em>The Class of '92</em>, told Ryan Giggs that he is a Sunderland fan that he realised what made Manchester United great. \"Most people laugh at me,\" Turner says. But not Giggs. United's new manager was having a flashback to something terrible instead.</p><p>\"He looked at us, no joke, and went: 'I seem to remember you beating us in 1997,'\" says Turner, who directed the film alongside his brother, Gabe. \"He remembered the one time we'd beaten them. That stuck in his mind. It was very much that sense of when you're on the beach, you think about the trophy you didn't win and, when you win it, you celebrate and move on. We were talking about the game. John Mullin scored the winning goal. I don't think he ever did anything else in a Sunderland shirt. But Giggs remembered the time he'd lost to us.\"</p><p>For Giggs, and the other members of that generation – Nicky Butt, David Beckham, the Neville brothers and Paul Scholes – losing was not an option. The film explores how these six boys came to dominate English football, and that conversation about a defeat in 1997 hammered home to Turner that it was an insatiable desire for victory that set them apart. It is why United turned to the class of '92 until the end of the season after David Moyes was sacked. Giggs and his assistants, Butt, Phil Neville and Scholes, have the club in their blood.</p><p>\"We spoke to Giggs, to congratulate him, and he said he didn't bat an eyelid when he was asked if he wanted the job,\" Turner says. \"He'd accepted it before they'd even finished asking him. They buy into the story of Manchester United.\"</p><p>Turner is not surprised that Giggs, the leader of the pack, is now the manager. \"If they were ever going to do it there was an unsaid feeling that he is the leader of the group, but they all wanted to be involved at United,\" he says. \"I mean, they managed to talk Scholes out of retirement and he's back now. He answered the call so quickly. But it's not a surprise that Giggs would be the manager.</p><p>\"They all have a lot of respect for him because he broke through first and he was the gold standard for them. I think they all look up to him.\"</p><p>Turner believes that success has not changed them as people. \"They are very down-to-earth,\" he says.</p><p>There is an aura to them, but also a sense of camaraderie – normal people whose childhood dream came true. \"They were like any group of old mates who'd been on an amazing adventure together. But they're very affectionate towards each other. They're very protective of each other and have a lot of respect. It seemed like a really balanced group of people, without any regrets. I don't know if they see each other all the time now, but they were very familiar instantly.\"</p><p>Turner admits he was worried about Scholes being too shy for the camera – fears that were soon allayed – while he remains hugely impressed with Butt. \"He was great,\" he says. \"People don't know him as much as the others, but he was one of the leaders when they were coming through and sort of looked after them. The leadership qualities and the status he has was a nice surprise.\"</p><p>A walk around Old Trafford brought home to Turner that he was in the company of living legends. \"It was very soon after they'd all kind of retired. There's a part of the museum at the ground about the class of '92 and I felt it was like watching them pass into mythology.</p><p>\"I was looking at the statue of Best, Law and Charlton as they were walking past it, and their achievements have eclipsed what those guys did. They're as big a legend as you can possibly be at that club. And as time goes by, their mythology will grow because when you don't see them play every week, the story grows.\"</p><p><em>An extended version of </em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Class-DVD-Ben-Turner/dp/B00FZLL06C\" title=\"\"><em>The Class Of '92</em></a><em> will be released on Blu-ray in early June</em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/435378160|2014-05-04T13:19:43Z|95f74ead0299843b95371f1920b25ad70a49db9e -->",

        "body":"<p>Wayne Rooney felt Manchester United provided the perfect response to what he described as a tough week with their 4-0 win against Norwich City.</p><p>Ryan Giggs assumed temporary control of the club on Tuesday following the sacking of David Moyes, and oversaw a comfortable victory. \"We knew it was going to be a tough game, Norwich are fighting for survival,\" Rooney told Sky Sports. \"But thankfully we got four goals and a comfortable win. We're the ones on the pitch, we have to take a lot of responsibility [for Moyes leaving].</p><p>\"We've had a tough week and there's been a lot of negativity towards us as a team. We were hurt by that and we wanted to put that right. It's important for us to end the season well.\"</p><p>Rooney was also full of praise for Giggs's impact on the team since taking charge, although stopped short of saying he should be the next United manager. \"Giggsy has come in, he's a really experienced player and he's built to be a manager,\" he said. \"We can see that as players, we can see how he's handled himself since he took over. Giggsy has got all the credentials to be the next boss but that decision is down to the board.\"</p><p>Juan Mata started the match on the bench but was delighted to have a chance to make his mark in a much-improved second-half display. \"We scored four times and we didn't concede a goal,\" he said. \"The first half was difficult but in the second half we showed what Manchester United can do at home.</p><p>\"We always try our best. Sometimes it's difficult to win, it's difficult to play. We didn't find enough space to create opportunities in the first half, but we're all together and our aim is to win the three games we have left.\" <strong> </strong></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/435391519|2014-05-04T13:19:43Z|9a16cd398508a0b96d3bd3060ac6e14826e8afbe -->",

        "headline":"Just like old times as Ryan Giggs keeps his promise to bring back smiles",
        "body":"<p>The sun shone on a late afternoon that had the Manchester United crowd smiling again now Ryan Giggs had supplanted David Moyes as manager. A week described as \"a whirlwind\" by the Welshman, who was given the job on an interim basis, was expected to end in cathartic victory.</p><p>The roar that greeted Giggs as he strode from tunnel to dugout would be the soundtrack to a new era – despite his truncated four-match tenure – in which United would rediscover the champagne football lost under Moyes.</p><p>Giggs, who slipped effortlessly into the role during Friday's first press briefing, had warned that 17th-placed Norwich City would arrive \"fighting for their lives\". The opening half of his \"reign\" hardly proved scintillating, though the feelgood factor ensured a step up in tempo. United dominated but passes still went awry, touch could be clumsy and the pattern sideways.</p><p>Giggs, looking sharp in club suit and shiny black shoes, prowled the technical area occasionally. When Norwich broke they did so at a pace that troubled United, who could be as flat-footed as in the worst times under the old manager.</p><p>After the travails of Moyes's doomed 10-month spell, during which the Scot did not retain the same XI once for his 51 matches in charge, Giggs's lineup for his inaugural game was a first point of intrigue. This would offer a clue to his United vision and signal whose slate was wiped clean now Moyes was gone.</p><p>It did not disappoint. Giggs dropped Juan Mata to the bench and Marouane Fellaini was left out of the squad. In one fell swoop £64.6m of Moyes's buys (his only two) appeared of questionable value, while Shinji Kagawa was recalled, along with Tom Cleverley and Rio Ferdinand.</p><p>To explain this, Giggs had said: \"The preparation's been good, and I just want to go out and enjoy it now. It's been surreal. Leaving players out has been the hardest part. To be honest I could have picked two teams. But that's why I'm in a job, I have to do it. Danny Welbeck scored at Norwich earlier this season, while Shinji Kagawa scored a hat-trick against them last season. That was in my thinking. Marouane Fellaini's unfortunate not to make the bench but he'll be involved in the coming weeks. I'd like to put my stamp on things, whether or not it's just for four games.\"</p><p>Some 32 minutes in and Cleverley suggested why Moyes had not fancied him. The United No23 took aim with a shot inside the area only to fashion one of those embarrassing miskicks that has the stadium in stunned silence before jeers break out. Still, the best move before the break derived from Kagawa, another of the Moyes forgotten men. The Japanese scooped a pass out to Phil Jones on the right then ran into the area. When the defender flicked the ball over it was Kagawa's right boot that nearly opened the scoring.</p><p>Moments later Wayne Rooney did, when Steven Whittaker pulled down Welbeck and Lee Probert awarded a penalty that was converted by the Merseysider.</p><p>During the first half a plane trailed a banner that said: \"Thank U Moyes – Malta FF\", apparently from a group of football fans on the island. It followed the one last month that informed Moyes he was \"The Wrong One\". Twenty-three seasons as United's most decorated footballer make Giggs a bona fide club legend and always \"The Right One\" in this parish. Yet nearly a quarter of a century on from his debut against Everton in this stadium, Giggs admitted feeling odd when sitting down to pen a first column as manager. \"I've supported United all my life and I've been connected with the club since I was at school,\" he wrote. \"It's the rock which my life has been built on and I can promise you that I will give this job the best I can in the last four games of the season.\"</p><p>As Giggs sent his players out for the second half he was 45 minutes from what was craved: a maiden win. When Rooney doubled the score by beating John Ruddy from distance only three minutes into the period the place relaxed, and the occasion could be enjoyed. Mata, on for Welbeck in Giggs's 4-3-3, confirmed the result with two strikes that allowed United to canter home.</p><p>Giggs had joined George Clarence \"Lal\" Hilditch as United's only player-manager. Hilditch took over in October 1926, earned less than £500 a year, and lasted 31 games in a six‑month tenure that remains the shortest of all United gaffers.</p><p>The club are pursuing Louis van Gaal to be the next full-time manager and Giggs seems certain to beat Hilditch's record for now. Do not be surprised if he is back one day, though, this time as the permanent No1.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/435390511|2014-05-04T13:19:43Z|fdcccaefed6b157e3354a9f2cac38d8df5b329ae -->",

        "headline":"Manchester United give Ryan Giggs fine start with Norwich demolition",
        "body":"<p>\"The Story Continues\" was the banner headline on Manchester United's match-day programme alongside a picture of Ryan Giggs, the club attempting to put some positive spin on a week of turmoil.</p><p>The worry for United supporters is how long the story will continue, with Sir Alex Ferguson giving his backing to Giggs even as rumours spread through Manchester that Louis van Gaal is now the chosen one and that a deal with the Holland coach may already have been agreed. At least this was a positive chapter, with Giggs receiving a tremendous ovation from the crowd as he made the touchline walk in club suit and tie. There was even a chant of \"Attack, attack, attack\" from the Stretford End as the game kicked off as if in anticipation of the shackles of unadventurous football being thrown off, plus any number of favourite hymns to Giggs and Paul Scholes.</p><p>Then Jonny Howson stuck the ball into David de Gea's net right under the Stretford End's noses and the home side could consider themselves warned.</p><p>The goal did not stand because Lee Probert had detected the slightest of pushes by Ricky van Wolfswinkel on Phil Jones, an offence not immediately obvious to anyone else in the stadium, and Norwich were denied what looked a perfectly good opener after producing a move more incisive than anything United had managed. Robert Snodgrass escaped Patrice Evra down the right and sent over a cross that Van Wolfswinkel nodded back across goal, and though Howson stuck the ball away to be on the safe side he had probably already heard the referee's whistle.</p><p>Danny Welbeck, newly restored to United's attacking lineup, forced a good stop from John Ruddy a couple of minutes later, though even by that stage the home side's initial attacking fervour had subsided. \"It took a bit of time for us to get going,\" Giggs admitted. \"The tempo in the first half wasn't as quick as I would have liked, but the goal came at the right time and at half-time I just told the lads to step it up.\"</p><p>While the scores were level Norwich were coping quite well, and by midway through the first half the atmosphere was so muted it was possible to hear the drone of the plane trailing a banner reading \"Thank U Moyes\" long before it was actually spotted. Not only does the story continue, it gets more surreal by the day.</p><p>Surreal was also the word to describe the manner in which United took the lead five minutes before the interval. After Antonio Valencia had brought another save from Ruddy, an inoffensive low cross from Jones was missed by just about everyone in the Norwich penalty area until it ran through to Welbeck. Steven Whittaker, as the last defender, tried to make up for the deficiencies of his team-mates by lunging for the ball but was unable to reach it, the striker was brought down instead and Wayne Rooney gratefully scored from the spot. Luck like that is the last thing a team in Norwich's position needs, though in truth the visitors had not helped themselves.</p><p>Allowed a surprising amount of time on the ball and possession in midfield, Norwich made little use of it. Even when they had men forward in numbers they failed to produce any real urgency and eventually paid a price for their timidity. The rest of the season could go the same way for Neil Adams and his players. Even the travelling supporters seemed resigned to their fate, reacting to going a goal behind with chants of \"Liverpool\" purely to annoy their hosts.</p><p>The Norwich players got the message, judging by the dreadful start they made to the second half. Shinji Kagawa was merely spreading play when he found Rooney wide on the left wing. It was hardly the sort of killer pass that immediately invites an attempt on goal, yet Norwich allowed Rooney to carry the ball all the way to the D by which time the crowd was screaming at him to shoot. He did, and Ruddy was beaten low to his left. \"That was the killer blow,\" Adams said. \"We need to be braver in our next two games. We were OK for the first 40 minutes but we need to make things happen.\"</p><p>The excellent Snodgrass refused to give up hope, reaching the byline and cutting back a near-perfect pass, except that Van Wolfswinkel overran it and no one else was following up to accept a clear opportunity. Snodgrass also produced a sharp save from De Gea with a free-kick he took himself after being fouled at the angle of the area by Nemanja Vidic, after Tom Cleverley had lost possession in the Norwich half. Given a chance by Giggs after almost disappearing under David Moyes, Cleverley did not seize it as well as Welbeck, who brought a flying save from Ruddy before making way for Mata after an hour.</p><p>It took Mata a matter of seconds to get on the scoresheet. The Spaniard turned up in the box at just the right time to turn in a cross from Jones after Ruddy had made another good save, this time from Rooney, without succeeding in pushing the ball dead. Mata scored a second when Evra's impressive cross from the left was turned back in by Valencia on the right, and United had four goals in a league game for the first time since, er, Moyes' last league game but one. And then the one before that. Which just goes to show that attacking football, like statistics, can mean whatever you want it to.</p><p>United were peppering Ruddy's goal as of old by the end and the Giggs interregnum is off to a highly encouraging start. The Stretford End was in full voice, the home side much more like their usual selves, though Norwich gave up the ghost shamefully on going behind. Giggs knows he will not meet opponents so lacklustre most weeks.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/435373975|2014-05-04T13:19:43Z|fd8b6d20ae90d58d3e9495236d86747513a7c28e -->",

His new position being Sir Alex Ferguson's old seat. Norwich City, sacrificial lambs, are expected to be slaughtered in a cathartic display of old-school brilliance, as under their new interim manager, United rediscover the United Way after the claggy failure of the David Moyes project. But even if United fail to click first time under Giggs, that's not really the point. This is the first symbolic step on the long walk back to happiness for the reigning champions. Old Trafford will be brimming with contentment tonight, whatever the outcome.</p><p><b>Norwich's chances of pooping the party are slim, mind you. </b>They've got the worst away record in the division - a mere eight points have been pecked up by the Canaries on the road - and they're currently on a four-game losing streak that looks like sending them back to the second tier. Four is highly likely to become five: Norwich have lost 4-0 on their last two visits to Old Trafford, last year in the league, and this season in the League Cup. They haven't won at United since Gary Pallister made his debut for the home team back in August 1989 and gave away a penalty which Robert Fleck gleefully converted to seal a 2-0 win for an on-the-ball City. A lot of water passed under the bridge since then.</p><p><b>No team can exist without a little hope, though. </b>And Norwich will be looking to build on their magnificent performance in the second half of their creditable 3-2 defeat at home to Liverpool last Sunday. Their high-pressure pressing game caused the league leaders no end of bother, and United haven't always responded well this season to incessant hassle like that. But the home side will be playing without fear or pressure tonight, and sure to be on the front foot this evening. Even a draw - priced at 5-1 by most reputable turf accountants - seems something of a pipe dream for City. Still, stranger things have happened to United at home this season - West Brom, Everton, Newcastle - so you never know. Whatever happens here tonight, this promises to be one to store away in the memory banks. It's on!</p><p><b>Kick off: </b>5.30pm</p> </div> </div><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/435322035|2014-05-04T13:19:43Z|545db087a738f241d79046c007be99b577e8d405 -->",

        "body":"<p>Poor <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/24/david-moyes-manchester-united-rene-meulenste\" title=\"\">David Moyes</a>. It must have been grim, having to stop being the chosen one in charge of the beautiful game at the thingy of dreams, after only 10 months, particularly with all those grinning players snickering over his misfortune, sorry tragedy (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global/blog/2014/apr/23/old-trafford-ferguson-moyes-manchester-united-tragedy\" title=\"\">Russell Brand™</a>), heedless of the part allegedly played by other men's hubris and greed.</p><p>Having said that, his particular story, for all its advertised mythic and moral resonance, surely challenges the popular Stalin line about the impact of a single tragedy, where a million is a statistic. Had a million top football managers been sacked last week, as opposed to one, it might have been possible to become interested. As it is, no disrespect to Moyes, but outside sport his downfall plainly moved many people exactly as much as we might expect a football manager to be touched, say, by the plight of any suddenly evicted middle-aged nonentity let go with no more than £5m in compensation.</p><p>True, courtesy of last week's immersive coverage, it would be perverse to deny that the Moyes story, unlike a common or garden sacking, came replete with metaphorical and psychological significance, and has therefore resonated, according to one of the BBC's more arcane sources of validation, as far away as Burma. No sooner had it become headline news on Tuesday, after that cruelly protracted period of speculative BBC bulletins – \"Manchester are said to be on the brink of sacking David Moyes\" – than commentators were asking what the sacking had to tell us beyond the fairly unsurprising fact, by then, of David Moyes being sacked, and of Man Utd fans therefore being exercised, even as far away as Burma.</p><p>What – other than keeping on losing – explained his downfall? And what could that tell us about leadership in general? Quite a lot, or, given the relevance in his case of long-distance management, spoiled youth and general footballing weirdness, quite breathtakingly little? And politics? Consider if our victim had not actually been David Moyes, but a party leader (of course you'd need to imagine a ministerial team in which Rooney and Giggs were assets) who had only been given 10 months in the job. Could the sacking, looked at in another way, tell us something about zero-hours contracts in what, one writer reminded us, is the \"precarious modern workplace\"? If not, there surely had to be horticultural implications, for those tempted to prune both too impetuously and too hard, and it is only extraordinary, given the measures to which the BBC resorted in its retellings of Moyes's short and uncomplicated story, that Alan Titchmarsh was not invited on a flagship news programme to make the obvious analogy between sacked coach and hapless shrub.</p><p>In fact, if the BBC executive looks back with satisfaction on a day in which the long-predicted sacking of a flagging football manager was the lead story on every news bulletin, as well as every sports one, and explored at length on the <em>World at One</em>, <em>PM</em> and <em>Newsnight</em>, inevitably to the detriment of what might conventionally have been considered the day's news, there can surely be no limit to such experiments in sports/news assimilation. What can the 3.15 at Newmarket tell us about Russian expansionism? Does the state of county cricket shed any light on the division between church and state?</p><p>Whether this enhanced level of sports fascination, which last week exceeded anything in the non red-top press, can be traced back to the Campbell/Blair locker-room, or to the Olympics or to a conviction among BBC managers that sports gossip is synonymous with friendly and accessible, there have been signs, for a while, that every BBC news programme really thinks it ought to be more like 5 live, to the point of requiring a sports-banter facility as part of the presenter skill-set.</p><p>Already it is becoming hard to imagine a specialist BBC correspondent who is not, like Man Utd fan Nick Robinson or Arsenal supporter Robert Peston, also able to expatiate, with bashful fluency, on the economic consequences of <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2613084/Ryan-Giggs-Robin-van-Persie-smiles-training-ground-months-heated-discussion-David-Moyes.html\" title=\"\">Robin van Persie</a>. And although, on the day of Moyes's tragedy, it was still possible to avoid all the above by switching to Radio 3, by the end of the week the classical station had announced a dedicated <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/proms/whats-on/2014/july-20/14924\" title=\"\">Sport Prom</a>, compered by BBC Sport's Gabby Logan, in which \"sporting celebrities select their favourite classical items and we relive unforgettable sporting moments on screens in the hall\". Stand by for Mario Balotelli's selection from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/oct/22/mario-balotelli-house-fire-fireworks\" title=\"\">Music for the Royal Fireworks</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/feb/27/nicola-anelka-suspended-five-matches-fa-quenelle\" title=\"\">Nicolas Anelka's</a> Wagner faves and Ryan Giggs's <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fccdGBi9JUs\" title=\"\">Madamina, il catalogo è questo </a>.</p><p>All this leaves a real gap in the market for a broadcaster who can still distinguish between international news and a story whose most memorable aspect may ultimately be, to non-fans, Russell Brand's depiction of Ferguson's appointment of Moyes as a sexual disgrace.</p><p>Or, as he put it: \"What I would do if invited to select my ex's next partner; the mendacious dispatch of a castrated chump to grimly jiggle with futile pumps upon Man United's bone-dry trophy-bare mound.\" To be fair, his designation of a Moyes defeat as a \"flaccid loss\" is equally unforgettable. While this type of analysis may well encapsulate, for the true fan – one thinks of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/jan/25/video-sky-sports-richard-keys\" title=\"\">Sky Sports' Andy Gray and Richard Keys</a> – what the beautiful game is all about, it cannot but confirm, for many non-hobbyists, that where football is concerned disproportionate media coverage of football privileges a culture that can be as incomprehensibly brutish as it is greedy and racist. No matter how carefully broadcasters now attempt to normalise the whole, ugly business with women presenters and theme tunes at the proms, they celebrate a world that <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2541112/Russell-Brand-opens-remaining-faithful-Jemima-Khan-appears-TV-dog.ht\" title=\"\">Jemima Khan's boyfriend</a> described as follows: \"Great men leave and lesser men fall but the game belongs to us all.\" Where \"all\", to judge by spectator figures, means more than 80% male.</p><p>Without question, football clubs would like more women supporters – imagine the money if they, too, could be induced to dress up in team colours, dutifully changing shirts every season – but the existing disparity of interest might, in an ideal world, occasionally detain a news organisation funded by both sexes. Not forgetting that many men, perhaps even some non-impotent ones, were equally baffled by editorial values that put squabbles at the theatre of dreams, as reports did not shrink from calling Mr Moyes's former place of work, ahead of Nigeria and Ukraine.</p><p>Perhaps the BBC's culture is still closer than one might think to the organisation where executives – actual, putative, always male – once capered around in football kit, hoping to head John, now Lord Birt, a promotion-quality ball? Because if not, surely its non-fan contingent should be quicker to remember that the corporation has, in addition to its endless sports bulletins, an entire channel dedicated to the free exchange of cliches about sporting matters: Radio 5 live, just celebrating its 20th birthday and plainly unconcerned that only <a href=\"http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/assets/files/pdf/our_work/r5_live/5live_5live_sports_extra.pdf\" title=\"\">28% of its listeners</a> are women.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/435338373|2014-05-04T13:19:43Z|7e8699e055cfabe7d696eb489ba42e13ac9c3455 -->",

        "headline":"Louis van Gaal: a manager of no compromises who knows his own mind",
        "body":"<p>In Louis Van Gaal Manchester United are pursuing a prime candidate to be their next permanent manager who was once described as \"God's father\".If <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/22/david-moyes-sacked-manchester-united\" title=\"\">David Moyes</a> was the shrinking violet who was sacked because he was too awed by the club to take it forward, United would be hiring the antithesis in a Dutchman whose confidence levels have earned him the nickname \"Iron Tulip\".</p><p>Van Gaal is rarely modest about his achievements as a manager. Following two years in charge of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/apr/10/louis-van-gaal-bayern-munich\" title=\"\">Bayern Munich</a>, from 2009-11, Van Gaal claimed he should take credit for the stellar sides of Jupp Heynckes and Pep Guardiola that have allowed \"Club Hollywood\" to dominate the European stage.</p><p>The Bayern president, Uli Hoeness, last year scoffed at this: \"Only Louis van Gaal can say something like that. Van Gaal's problem is not that he's God, but he's God's very own father. Louis was already there before the world even existed. If you look at the world from that perspective, like Van Gaal does, it is&nbsp;hard to see what the world really looks like.</p><p>\"Van Gaal is a good coach who cleaned up Jürgen Klinsmann's inheritance. That's his role in Bayern's recent development. But that's all he has contributed to the club's success. And he didn't play a role in Guardiola's appointment either.\"</p><p>Van Gaal's response was all that might be expected from a 62-year-old who does not do compromise. \"I am the captain beside God. And Hoeness thinks he's God,\" he said.</p><p>How the blunt Dutchman fits into the United dynamic should be fascinating and could be the key factor should on-field displays dip. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/may/08/alex-ferguson-retires-manchester-united\" title=\"\">Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement</a> last year ended a near 27-year reign when all at United were conscious of precisely where power was held: in the Scot's iron grip. The removal of Moyes on Tuesday throws light again on the ongoing struggle at United's Carrington training complex and in the executive offices of Old Trafford.</p><p>If hired, Van Gaal will be walking into an institution that continues to experience the first tremors of instability since Ferguson took charge in 1986 and begin building his empire.</p><p>United favour Van Gaal because of an impressive CV that – apart from four years at AZ – features tenures managing only heavyweight European clubs, the Holland national team, and the super-ego footballers who have passed under his tutelage since commencing his career at Ajax in 1991.</p><p>Van Gaal is in a second spell with Holland – the plan is for him to join United officially once his World Cup duties are over – he has twice managed Barcelona, and spent six years at Ajax, as well as the two leading Bayern.</p><p>United are ruled by the Glazers and their man-across-the-Atlantic, Ed Woodward, the vice-chairman who speaks with the owners on a daily basis. Also on the executive is the powerful Ferguson-Sir Bobby Charlton-David Gill axis, with the former manager's comments that Ryan Giggs, the interim manager, should be given the job full-time a reaffirmation of the influence the 71-year-old still wields, despite how dire his recommendation of his fellow Scot proved.</p><p>Further down the club is a stronghold that enjoys backing from a key constituency: the fans. At Carrington Giggs has, as assistants, Paul Scholes, Nicky Butt and Phil Neville, to make a formidable Class of '92 gang of four who lead the squad and were hardly vocal in offering Moyes support during the doomed 10-month tenure.</p><p></p><p>So how political an animal will Van Gaal prove when required? \"If he is smart, he chooses someone from the '92 class as his assistant,\" a friend of his told the <em>Observer</em>. \"He will be aware of this group, and of how to win its support. I think he knows all about it. Yet, ultimately, this will all be about how Van Gaal wants his vision of football to be played. If there is a difference of opinion he won't take any of the '92 class on his staff just to be friends.\"</p><p>The same logic will apply to Woodward, Ferguson et al. \"That will be interesting to see – how he deals with those kind of powerful figures,\" the friend adds. \"Van Gaal is someone who doesn't make compromises. Look at what happened at Bayern with Uli Hoeness. Like with Ferguson, if Van Gaal has something to say, if he is angry, or whatever, he will tell them to their face, blunt. Then, it is up to the other person how they deal with it.</p><p>\"Maybe someone at United says to him: 'We want a break from Ferguson, you don't have to have Giggs or whoever.' But Van Gaal will make his own mind up. At Barcelona [in 1997], he took José Mourinho as assistant, who had once been only the translator there. Barcelona wanted someone else but Louis van Gaal said: 'I'll take him because he knows the players.'\"</p><p>The word from the top of the club is, indeed, that Van Gaal – or any new incumbent – can choose who he wants. Yet if the Dutchman were to discard Giggs, Scholes, Butt and Neville, rumblings of discontent would follow should United begin sliding down the table.</p><p>\"His first choice would be Frank de Boer but he is at Ajax. Patrick Kluivert maybe his assistant as he is with Holland but never his first assistant, so maybe he takes someone like Giggs,\" says the&nbsp;friend.</p><p>At Bayern, Van Gaal won the power struggle with Hoeness in his first season after the claiming of the Bundesliga, German Cup and reaching the Champions League final in May 2010, where his team lost to Mourinho's Inter. But when results faltered the following term he was sacked.</p><p>One battle that will not need fighting is the lowering of expectation following a campaign under Moyes that featured dull football and dreadful results. Now, the Old Trafford congregation hunger for a return to the United way of attacking play. Van Gaal should guarantee such a revival. He favours a high, pressing style, often with pace and width when going forward. At Bayern, he bought Arjen Robben to join Franck Ribéry to ensure this. At United, Van Gaal would face a more widescale rebuilding job of the squad. How he addresses this while also being a particularly politic off-field United manager should define the success of his time at the club.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/435375346|2014-05-04T13:19:43Z|ddb622659359e37843743e36c79ff66b2b04617d -->",

        "headline":"Tony Pulis and Brendan Rodgers survive tricky time for British managers",
        "body":"<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/apr/21/david-moyes-manchester-united-manager-alex-ferguson\" title=\"\">David Moyes was the 10th Premier League manager to lose his job this season</a> and the fifth British casualty. For years it seemed unlikely that one of the big, top-four clubs would ever turn to a homegrown product from lower in the same league instead of a ready-made import from Europe, then two things happened at once.</p><p>First, the groundbreaking appointment of Moyes never got off the ground, precisely because Manchester United's finely honed playing staff were dismissive of his humble background and limited outlook. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/apr/21/david-moyes-manchester-united-manager-five-contenders\" title=\"\">The club are back to lining up European supercoaches now</a>, so it could be the case that Moyes's unhappy experience has set the cause of British managers back by several years. Except for the other concurrence, in which Liverpool fell so far down the league they began to hire British coaches again, and eventually found one so capable he returned them unstoppably to the dizzy heights United had unexpectedly vacated. While Liverpool are now a top-four club with a dynamic young British coach, the sequence of events could not have happened in any other order.</p><p>The moral of the story is that British coaching talent can still be found, though United should note that it helps to go through an interview process rather than blighting some honest plodder's life with an offer he feels unable to refuse. Brendan Rodgers is full of good ideas, even if he prefers to call them projects, but his coaching credentials are solid and there is no doubt he can back up the talk with results. Someone at Liverpool must have had their head screwed on because they interviewed Roberto Martínez at the same time, another manager with potential who has since showed his worth elsewhere.</p><p>Martínez cannot be classed as homegrown, though as he has been here for 18 of his 40 years and worked in England, Scotland and Wales he knows more than most about British football. He, too, exudes poise and confidence, qualities Moyes conspicuously lacked in the Old Trafford spotlight, and Dave Whelan's quip that United had overlooked the best candidate does not look quite so silly now, even if the training ground resistance might have been even more extreme towards a manager who had just been relegated. A club of United's size and status will only take a risk once in a while, and when they see it explode in their face – and the whole point of Moyes's six-year contract was to try to take the risk out of the succession – it will be back to the usual suspects for the foreseeable future.</p><p>The cull of British managers this season was particularly hard on Scots, with Moyes, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/dec/27/malky-mackay-sacked-cardiff\" title=\"\">Malky Mackay</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/dec/14/west-bromwich-albion-sack-steve-clarke\" title=\"\">Steve Clarke </a>being edged out to leave Paul Lambert precariously situated as the only remaining representative of what Sir Alex Ferguson was fond of referring to as the master race. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/oct/23/ian-holloway-leaves-crystal-palace-mutual-consent\" title=\"\">Ian Holloway</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/06/norwich-city-sack-chris-hughton-neil-adams\" title=\"\">Chris Hughton</a> were the other Brits to lose their jobs, yet looking on the bright side half the clubs in the Premier League can still boast British managers. There were 11 at the start of the season and 10 now, which does not sound too unhealthy apart from the consideration that Ryan Giggs, Tim Sherwood, Garry Monk and Neil Adams are managing on a temporary basis. All are likely to be replaced by next season, and it will be a major surprise if the more high-profile situations are filled with British names rather than European imports.</p><p>Yet surprises do happen in football, and the almost unthinkable notion that the ultimate roundhead Tony Pulis could be interesting Spurs amounts to deserved recognition for one of the outstanding managerial feats of recent seasons. The manager of the year award would be an even more appropriate acknowledgment of what <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/apr/24/crystal-palace-tony-pulis-premier-league-survival\" title=\"\">Pulis has achieved since taking over an apparent basket-case at Crystal Palace</a>, though should Rodgers succeed in guiding Liverpool to a first title in 24 years the panel of judges will have an extremely difficult choice. Both are deserving, and both are British, so at least there will be a new addition to a list dominated in recent seasons by Ferguson (11 times) or other members of the top-four elite. The only exceptions this century have been George Burley, Harry Redknapp and Alan Pardew, which may not fill this season's candidates with confidence for the future.</p><p>The present, however, is still taking shape. Liverpool will be widely regarded as a shoo-in for the title should they beat Chelsea on Sunday, yet they still face what is now a tricky visit to Selhurst Park on 5 May. With Manchester City on Sunday and then Fulham as a final fixture, maybe Pulis's work is not finished yet, even though Palace are safe. For once the issues at the top and bottom of the Premier League table are not in the hands of the Glazers but the Glaziers.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/435328221|2014-05-04T13:19:43Z|42f8e2fc6610ca37124338c7ac5e581d1154f9a6 -->",

        "body":"<p>Louis van Gaal is now the clear frontrunner to take over as Manchester United manager because of the complications associated with trying to lure <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/25/carlo-ancelotti-real-madrid-manchester-united-david-moyes\" title=\"\">Carlo Ancelotti away from Real Madrid</a>. Ed Woodward, the United executive with responsibility for finding <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/22/david-moyes-sacked-manchester-united\" title=\"\">a permanent successor to David Moyes</a>, is aware that arranging a deal for Ancelotti will be difficult to the point of improbable and that makes Van Gaal the strong favourite to take over next season.</p><p>United's information is that Van Gaal wants the job, with Patrick Kluivert as his assistant, although the downside of employing the Holland manager is that he will <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/22/louis-van-gaal-manchester-united-colourful-controversial\" title=\"\">not be able to start until after the World Cup</a> and that means Woodward is already pressing ahead with what promises to be an extensive summer of transfer business. High-level sources have confirmed he has held detailed discussions about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/23/manchester-united-edinson-cavani-cesc-fabregas\" title=\"\">Edinson Cavani's potential availability at Paris Saint-Germain</a>, including at least one meeting in France, and it has also emerged that United's interest in resurrecting a deal for Cesc Fábregas is harder than initially thought. The former Arsenal midfielder has been identified as the player United want the most, having missed out on him last summer <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/feb/14/cesc-fabregas-flattered-manchester-united\" title=\"\">when Barcelona turned down bids of £25m and £30m</a>.</p><p>Ancelotti has been discussed at length, but so have José Mourinho and Pep Guardiola and, in all three cases, United suspect the probability of securing them ranges from low to nonexistent. That may change in Ancelotti's case, depending on what happens at Real Madrid between now and the end of the season. United are keeping an open mind in case the Champions League semi-finalists fall short in their attempt to win more silverware. Even then, however, there is nothing to make them believe that Ancelotti's position will be vulnerable if he finishes the season <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/16/barcelona-real-madrid-copa-del-rey-match-report-gareth-bale\" title=\"\">with only the Copa del Rey</a>.</p><p>The shortlist, headed by Van Gaal, also features Antonio Conte of Juventus as well as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/mar/01/diego-simeone-atletico-madrid-real-madrid-derby-la-liga\" title=\"\">Diego Simeone, the Atlético Madrid coach</a>. Roberto Mancini is keen to return to English football after struggling to settle in Istanbul with Galatasaray and wants to be considered, despite having previously managed Manchester City.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/26/manchester-united-louis-van-gaal\" title=\"\">United have denied reports in Holland</a> that Van Gaal has already agreed a deal but the process is under way and it increasingly appears as though his appointment could be finalised in the next couple of weeks. Kluivert, one of his Holland assistants, was quoted on TalkSport as saying he would like to be part of Van Gaal's back room staff at United.</p><p>The delay until a possible mid-July start is not regarded as a deal-breaker and United believe they are already in a strong position transfer-wise because of several months of work behind the scenes involving Woodward, Moyes and their network of agents and scouting staff. Cavani would cost up to £60m, breaking United's transfer record, and it might need about £40m if they are to stand any chance of succeeding where they failed with Fábregas last summer.</p><p>Again, the deal is highly complicated because of the politics of Barcelona selling one of their local players and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/oct/25/cesc-fabregas-manchester-united-barcelona\" title=\"\">Fábregas's apparent reluctance to rock the boat with the club</a> that have been such an important part of his life. However, United's information is that it is negotiable and, as long as that is the case, they will press ahead to try to see whether the 26-year-old is as unsettled as they have been informed.</p><p>Cavani would suit Woodward's ambitions to bring in one of the sport's modern superstars but there is a recognition that the more urgent need is to strengthen the team's midfield and defence. The club have reluctantly accepted that Porto's Eliaquim Mangala will end up at Manchester City but other players in that position have been identified to replace <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/05/manchester-united-nemanja-vidic-internazionale\" title=\"\">the departing Nemanja Vidic</a> and Rio Ferdinand. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/23/manchester-united-beat-chelsea-luke-shaw-transfer-david-moyes\" title=\"\">A £30m deal for Southampton's Luke Shaw</a> is likely to mean Patrice Evra leaving but United consider the Frenchman such an influential member of the squad there is an option for him to sign a year-long contract extension. \"He is almost as important in the dressing room as Ryan Giggs,\" one source said.</p><p>United have been working on their recruitment programme since the turn of the year and there is more of an understanding this time that it is important to have contingency plans in place in case deals fall through.</p><p>Behind the scenes, for example, it has been pointed out that Sir Alex Ferguson thought he had transfers arranged for Karim Benzema, Alexis Sánchez <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/jul/23/manchester-united-lucas-moura\" title=\"\">and Lucas Moura in recent years</a>. The problem has sometimes been that there has not been a second or even third choice identified. That will not be the case this summer.</p><p>There have been enquiries about Nani, Shinji Kagawa and Javier Hernández and United will have to decide who they let go in the summer.</p><p>The recent publicity surrounding <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/20/danny-welbeck-unhappy-future-manchester-united-moyes\" title=\"\">Danny Welbeck's apparent unhappiness is not being regarded with great alarm</a> at Old Trafford and, potentially, is part of a strategy on the striker's part to be given a new contract, two years from the end of his current deal.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/435365962|2014-05-04T13:19:43Z|2dc4b1a49924030169abaf26c8c3c98cbd28032f -->",

        "body":"<p>Sir Alex Ferguson believes Ryan Giggs should become the next permanent Manchester United manager despite the club viewing the 40-year-old as lacking the requisite experience to become David Moyes's long-term successor.</p><p>Giggs was given the role on an interim basis on Tuesday after the sacking of Moyes. While the Welshman was happy to accept the job for only the last four matches of the season, Giggs is open to being the long-term No1.</p><p>Despite Ferguson's backing of Moyes proving a dire miscalculation after the Scot lasted only 10 months of a six-year contract, the 71-year-old has no doubts that Giggs can succeed in the post.</p><p>\"I think that he [Giggs] is the one man they should go to, really,\" Ferguson said at a fundraising dinner in Manchester this week. \"He's got 20-odd years of experience at Manchester United. I signed him as a kid at 13 years of age. He's gone through the gamut of emotions at the club – he's experienced all the highs and lows. He knows exactly what's needed to be a Manchester United player and I was so pleased he brought Paul Scholes back in, and Nicky Butt of course – two great professionals.</p><p>\"They understand the club, they are hard workers, they are straight as a die. So you have got the right combinations there, there's no doubt about that.\"</p><p>Giggs stated at his media briefing before Saturday's visit of Norwich City to Old Trafford that he and Ferguson have ongoing contact. \"He was the first person I picked the phone up to,\" the 40-year-old said.</p><p>Kenny Dalglish and Pep Guardiola, at Liverpool and Barcelona respectively, were each managers of no or limited experience who proved successful. \"Yes, it can happen,\" Giggs said.</p><p>Ferguson, before retiring last May, had talked of establishing a structure at United similar to Bayern Munich, where key roles are occupied by former successful players.</p><p>He has underlined that he believes this can still be achieved. \"One of the things we have been criticised about over the years is succession planning,\" he said. \"It's a very difficult industry to say you can have succession planning. But in the case of what we were doing in the last few years, with bringing Nicky Butt into the fold, Ryan into the fold, Paul Scholes into the fold, and Gary Neville was offered a position but he decided to go into television. He could easily come back.</p><p>\"The model is Bayern Munich where they had [Karl-Heinz] Rummenigge, [Gerd] Müller, [Uli] Hoeness, [Franz] Beckenbauer and [Sepp] Maier all in the camp. They were all there with their knowledge of the great Bayern Munich teams. And that was our model, and it wasn't really until David Gill came in we started doing that. And what's what we see today.\"</p><p>Ferguson added: \"Paul Scholes is one of these guys who has few words but the few words are so succinct, accurate and to the point. He is brilliant at it. Many times I would bring in the older guard to discuss certain things that we maybe wanted their opinion on. Scholesy had three or four words – bang, bang, bang. He was such a revelation for me for a young man to be so positive, a decision maker.</p><p>\"I think Ryan will get the benefit of that now. That was the first thing Ryan did; he phoned up Scholesy – he was on holiday and called him back.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/435351017|2014-05-04T13:19:43Z|bcdd63d5bed26c8915de0c453d80d6a046752c69 -->",

        "headline":"Ryan Giggs promises free expression in return to Manchester United roots",
        "body":"<p>The first thing Ryan Giggs did on becoming Manchester United's interim manager was pick up the phone to call Sir Alex Ferguson. \"Why wouldn't I? He's been through everything you can as a manager, as a young manager, as an experienced manager, as a successful manager,\" the 40-year-old said. \"Yeah, he's given me advice, he's told me that he's always at the end of the phone and that's obviously given me a lot of comfort and it's good to know I can turn to the manager if I ever need him.\"</p><p>Giving his opening press conference at United's Carrington training complex, Giggs, dressed in shorts and red training top, was assured and at ease. Yet the Freudian slip of how he still views Ferguson – as \"the manager\" – spoke volumes, and illustrated how tough it was always going to be for David Moyes, who was sacked on Tuesday.</p><p>The Scot was the elephant in the room. Before Giggs started Karen Shotbolt, the manager's press officer, announced he would say a few words about his predecessor and that would be it: no questions would be welcomed on Moyes's doomed 10-month tenure. \"I'd like to thank David for giving me my first chance in coaching,\" the Welshman said. \"It was something I'll always remember when he rang me in the summer and asked me to come on board.\"</p><p>Yet Moyes was, of course, touched upon by implication virtually every time Giggs offered a response on how he viewed the season and the new United under him. The generally breezy way that proceedings were handled was in direct contrast to how the uber-cautious Moyes addressed the media. Under Moyes, the Premier League holders plunged to seventh place, a yawning 13 points from a Champions League berth, before Ed Woodward, the executive vice-chairman, finally axed the 50-year-old and handed Giggs the chance to put down a managerial calling card.</p><p>Asked if the players should feel guilty about any of this, Giggs's answer was smooth yet steely. \"I don't think guilty, but as a Man United player you have got to set standards. I want to bring those standards back up to here,\" he said, raising his hand above his head. \"Where a Manchester United player should be. And not just for one game, for every game. Every time you pull on the red shirt you give everything you have got, otherwise you're coming off.</p><p>\"My philosophy is the Manchester United philosophy,\" he added. \"I want players to play with passion, speed, tempo and be brave, with imagination, all the things that are expected of a Manchester United player. I want to see goals, tackles, players taking players on and getting the crowd up. I want to give the fans something to smile about in the remaining four games. It's been a frustrating season and I want to end it on a high. The stadium will be bouncing.\"</p><p>The bluntness will be welcomed by the congregation and indicates that Giggs is not swept away by emotion or dazzled by United's star. With Moyes the sense was always of a man in awe of the 20-times champions, Ferguson's successful 26-year tenure and the challenge of defending a title won by 11 points. Giggs has got instantly down to business. There was another glimpse of how positivity will come blended with hard sense, when he described his message when the team takes the field.</p><p></p><p>\"I'll tell the players just to try to enjoy yourself, express yourself,\" he said, but then fingered them for Sunday's dire 2-0 defeat at Everton that proved the executioner's song for Moyes. \"I don't know if I'd be saying that as manager last week because the performance wasn't great.\"</p><p>Pressed about what it had been like watching from the bench as Moyes's former side humiliated United – and the Scot – before the Goodison Park crowd, Giggs said: \"It was a disappointing performance. You sometimes get games like that, you're 2-0 down and you're chasing and it gets messy. But it wasn't good enough.\"</p><p>The description of how a contest can become \"messy\" was offered with conviction, and brought to mind Gary Neville, Giggs's great friend, when he analyses the game. With David Beckham, United's former captain is the only other vaunted name from the so-called Class of '92 youth team not now involved at the club. Giggs has asked Nicky Butt to step up from the reserves and ensured Phil Neville remained from Moyes's staff, while Paul Scholes was also brought in.</p><p>\"They are Man United fans and played for the club for the majority of their careers, with myself and Scholesy just one club,\" Giggs said of the gang of four. \"They will give everything in a short time to try and end what has been a frustrating season on a high.</p><p>\"It's a tough job and you need as much help as you can get and I've had that this week off them. Phil has been frustrated, just like I have because he's been on board all season. He's taken training, organised everything and taken the weight off my shoulders. I can't speak highly enough of Phil.\"</p><p>Frustration can be the diplomat's word for discontent. On Sunday, Liverpool can all but claim a 19th title, one behind United's count, if Chelsea are beaten at Anfield. Giggs was asked if their success has deepened the pain. Eventually, he smiled. \"It's not been easy. I mean we'll wait to see what happens. We spent so many years trying to catch them, then overtaking them. But credit to them, they have been brilliant this season,\" he said. Would he prefer Manchester City to be champions? \"No comment.\"</p><p>The press conference was peppered with humour that enhanced the picture of a man who believed he was where he should be: in the No1's hot seat. Asked if he might select himself for the first game, Norwich City's visit on Saturday, Giggs quipped: \"I've just given myself a five-year contract, while I can. I've trained OK this week and looked sharp, to be fair. No, everyone has looked sharp, 20-odd players are in with a chance.\"</p><p>To whether all of Butt, Scholes and Neville would be in the technical area - the questioner meant on the bench - in a flash Giggs joked: \"Hopefully not in the technical area, no. That means we're 3-0 down. Again, no, I haven't decided what I'm wearing yet or who is going to be in the dug-out.\"</p><p>There had also been a laugh from Giggs when Shotbolt introduced him as \"David\", before correcting herself to \"Ryan\", a moment not disrespectful to Moyes, more an indicator of the vortex Giggs finds himself at the centre of.</p><p>\"It's been a bit of a whirlwind week but one I've enjoyed – it has been different, chaotic and I've been getting a little taste as it's my fourth day in the job,\" said Giggs. \"I can never have imagined what you have to do and the things it entails being a Manchester United manager.\"</p><p>He was neatly honest about what it is like sitting in Ferguson's old chair. \"Lonely, lonely. It's been chaotic and you are getting pulled from pillar to post and then you go and sit in the office and are just writing some notes down,\" he said. \"The thing is you're just trying not to forget anything because there are so many things happening, so many things going on and it is a pretty lonely place at times. But I'm enjoying it.\"</p><p>His new charges have been teasing him. \"I have had to take a bit of stick. Things like 'where are you going to park?' I had a gaffer sign on my place in the dressing room,\" said Giggs. \"They have been great.\"</p><p>Purposely or not, Giggs signalled a further break with Moyes by moving the briefing from the main Carrington building back to the academy facility where Ferguson held court for the latter part of his reign. A 9.30am start - before training - was also reverted to, with 1.30pm having been favoured by Moyes.</p><p>Along from where Giggs sat were photos of academy players, in four of which he was featured. These included a shot of his most famous goal, the winner against Arsenal in the 1999 FA Cup semi-final, plus pictures with Beckham, Gary Neville and Scholes. Part of the legend on the wall reads: \"Our responsibility to the future of the game is to give budding talent the very best opportunity to flourish.\"</p><p>Sitting where Ferguson had for so many years, Giggs was the prime evidence of the ethos, and there was little difficulty imagining him as a permanent incumbent of the position. The word from the club is that Giggs is viewed as such in the future, but currently lacks the requisite experience.</p><p>Yet when it was put to him how Kenny Dalglish at Liverpool and Pep Guardiola at Barcelona enjoyed success when starting as callow managers, Giggs said: \"Yes, it can happen but it's not something I'm thinking of at the moment. That's another conversation to be had three weeks, six weeks, whenever in the future.</p><p>\"It's probably the proudest moment of my career. The hairs on the back of my neck will be standing up. I know Old Trafford will be rocking, I know the fans will be behind us. I know the players can't wait, my staff can't wait, I can't wait. I just want it to come.</p><p>\"I'll look forward to the game just as I did as a player. You prepare yourself during the week and can't wait for Saturday to come, 5.30pm against Norwich, I know the stadium will be bouncing.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/435325215|2014-05-04T13:19:43Z|fcab1c1774306953591e40dc140d4f26f9e348f1 -->",

        "body":"<h2>PANINI TOAST</h2><p></p><p>Late this morning, the Fiver stuck out the tip of its tongue, furrowed its brow, narrowed its eyes, entered the zone and in deep concentration, embarked on a major technical engineering project. It plucked Ryan Giggs from its pile of Panini spares, peeled away the back, then carefully lined up, with great precision, the fresh sticker over the box on the Manchester United page reserved for David Moyes. And with one confident downward press followed by a slow, smooth swipe designed to iron out any air bubbles, the Football 14 album was complete! The Fiver folded its lolling tongue back in its slavering maw, and scampered off excitedly to show Granny Fiver. She said she was very happy Moyes had been sacked, as he was the only sticker the Fiver didn't have, and it ensured she wouldn't have to make a £745 postal application to get it. She also said that, having finally completed a set at the age of 41, it might now be time for the Fiver to leave the world of stickers behind, and it would probably also be an idea to stop scribbling on the kitchen walls, putting slices of jam on toast into the CD player, and talking at the dinner table about logs and jobbies.</p><p></p><p>A tearful Fiver promised to try.</p><p></p><p>The Fiver was able to complete Football 14 in this way because, of course, Giggs was unveiled today as the new interim manager of United. \"This is the proudest moment of my life,\" said the superannuated winger, following as he is in the footsteps of player-manager legends such as Kenny Dalglish, who won a double in 1986 with Liverpool, Franz Beckenbauer, who with Helmut Schön in a flat spin effectively guided West Germany through the latter stages of the 1974 World Cup both on and off the pitch, and Dennis Wise. Giggs promised to \"put the smiles back on fans' faces\" and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/25/ryan-giggs-put-smiles-fans-faces-manchester-united-manager\" title=\"\">explained exactly how he planned to do it</a>. \"Passion, speed, tempo, be brave, imagination. Work hard but most of all enjoy it. I've told the players, I trust you and know what you're capable of. Now go out there and show it.\" So if United beat Norwich City 7-0 tomorrow, you'll know that all the folk droning on and on about the grave importance of tactics have been talking through their hats all this time.</p><p></p><p>Giggs dodged questions regarding his chances of getting the gig permanently, insisting that he hadn't even decided whether he was going to wear a tracksuit or adult clobber tomorrow, never mind considered life after the season. He was even relaxed enough to crack the first joke at a Manchester United press conference in 28 years, claiming that as boss, he was planning on awarding himself a five-year contract. A confident and promising start, then. Of course, only time will tell whether Giggs has the managerial know-how, natural instinct and raging monomania required to take on one of the biggest jobs in world football with next to no experience. But just in case he doesn't, the Fiver, ever the completist, has made sure to get its hands on a spare Louis van Gaal sticker or two, and furthermore will be making no comment on the van <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/25/panini-world-cup-sticker-heist\" title=\"\">carrying 300,000 packets of World Cup Panini</a> which has just been stolen in Rio de Janeiro.</p><p></p><h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2><p></p><p><strong>24 April:</strong> \"This week has almost been a relief in that I knew it was coming for so long\" – Stevenage boss Graham Westley reflects on the club's relegation to League Two.</p><p></p><p><strong>25 April:</strong> \"Reports that I was 'relieved' at being relegated couldn't be further from the truth. That is twisting the context of the conversation that took place and that is so wrong. The fact is I have never worked harder than I have this season to deliver football performances for the fans. I have driven 22,000 miles in six months watching games and players and given everything I've got to work with the players I inherited. This season has been one of blood and sweat for me and now I have the tears to go with it … I am not used to dropping backwards. I am furious at it and I am now raging to bounce back. I want to build a squad of players that I believe can do that. The decks are now clear\" – Westley gets it all out.</p><p></p><h2>FIVER LETTERS</h2><p></p><p>\"Dear Luis Suárez, I appreciate that Plucky Little Liverpool may well be on the verge of something amazing, but can we clear up the, now widespread, fallacy that you are 'doing it on a budget' (yesterday's Bits and Bobs)? Liverpool have spent £180m net across the last five seasons to arrive at this current squad, you also have the fourth highest wage bill when figures were last revealed. While I appreciate that we are not talking about oil-backed squillions spent by others, Liverpool are not victims of 'so little investment' as you think, unless that phrase means something wildly different in Uruguayan\" – Kevin Smyth.</p><p></p><p>\"I thought you would be delighted to know that yesterday's Fiver was not the least informative football tea-time email I received. <a href=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/4/25/1398420658933/Picture_256.png\" title=\"\">This is the latest from the Scotland Supporters' Club News</a> – unfortunately, as it is a World Cup year, there is not much happening.

Furthermore, I had to endure 10 iPad 'pages' of Manchester Disunited 'in turmoil' after a bloke was fired from his job, with not one single paragraph about City.

        "headline":"From dressing room to dugout: how life will change for Ryan Giggs",
        "body":"<p>Ryan Giggs has, at various junctures in his 24-season Manchester United career, appeared to carry the club on his shoulders but never quite like this. When he makes that walk from Old Trafford's home dressing room on Saturday into the tunnel and out into the swathe of colour and sound, a very different responsibility will be his. Different emotions will swirl.</p><p>Giggs's crossover into management has had an inevitable feel to it but now that it is upon him, after what has been a week of turmoil at United, marked by the sacking of David Moyes on Tuesday, it seems indecently abrupt. The 40-year-old may be in temporary charge only for the season's final four games, beginning with the visit of Norwich City, but he nonetheless enters the annals as the club's ninth manager of the post-war era and the first to step directly from the playing squad into the dugout.</p><p>It is a peculiar move that scrambles the dynamics and presents a host of challenges. Precious few have taken it in recent years, and not only because the player-manager feels like a dying breed. It has become hugely difficult to combine the roles at the highest level and it was notable that when Garry Monk went from player to manager at Swansea City in February, following the dismissal of Michael Laudrup, the 35-year-old made it clear that he would not pick himself. Giggs being Giggs, he has ruled nothing out.</p><p>It is hard enough for any player to switch into management. Virtually to a man, they talk of how they see their workload multiply; how the job is all-consuming and a far cry from having merely to look after their own individual interests.</p><p>\"You're under so much more scrutiny,\" Monk says. \"It's every tactical decision, every substitution, every bit of preparation and it's not just from the outside. Players will question 'Why are we doing this and that?' You have to have the answers.\"</p><p>The football is only part of it and Alan Smith, the former Crystal Palace manager, remembers how the non-footballing things accounted for \"60%\" of his week – namely reporting to the board, handling the media, organising people, planning over several games, and listening to any off-field issues that the players may have had.</p><p>Rookie managers also have to get to grips with speaking in group situations, analysing opponents, getting the information across to the players and working out training strategies. Even reading and communicating scouting reports tends to be new.</p><p>Almost every scenario, though, is made more intense and often more difficult when the manager has recently crossed from the playing staff. The chemistry with former team-mates, who were once brothers-in-arms during weekly battles, can never be the same.</p><p>\"I only know with Gareth Southgate at Middlesbrough and he just found it impossible,\" Smith says, of the former England defender, who went from captain at the Riverside to manager in 2006. Smith was employed as a consultant towards the end of Southgate's tenure.</p><p>\"It's just so difficult, especially when they are your mates and they know absolutely everything about you, every silly thing that you've ever done. With Ryan Giggs, because of who he is, it is perceived that it will be different but I just don't know. There is nothing that players of his generation at United will not know about him. I don't know that the dynamic can change overnight.\"</p><p>Southgate – now the England Under-21 manager – found it hard at Middlesbrough, particularly when he had to drop or discipline former team-mates. The club was relegated in 2008-09, a season in which Southgate's £12m signing, Afonso Alves, scored only four Premier League goals.</p><p>\"When I got the job, Sir Alex Ferguson told me I didn't have enough experience,\" Southgate says. \"He reiterated that at an LMA dinner and he was absolutely right. It would probably have been less painful for me to take a different path. The ideal scenario is you start off in management by coaching kids. They will listen more than senior pros and won't be quite so critical of your training sessions.\"</p><p>A group of Premier League footballers is a tough crowd and it is probably wise to adopt a thick skin and accept that there will be no pleasing all of them. As a very short-term caretaker, Giggs will at least be spared some of the biggest problems of management, such as player contracts and the transfer market.</p><p>\"The players are going to look at you differently,\" Monk says. \"You have to accept that. You're going from a place where you've been very good friends, talking day in, day out to where they're probably going to withhold certain things and vice versa. It's difficult. Players will come in and ask why they are not playing. I've just tried to be honest with everyone.\"</p><p>Monk tells the story of travelling back from defeats on the team bus as a player and manager respectively. He has always taken defeats badly but, as a player, he and his team-mates would, after an hour or so, begin to chirp up again. When he hears the laughter from the back of the bus these days, it drives him crackers. \"And it's a double-edged sword,\" he adds. \"Defeat cuts deeper as a manager, massively so, while the highs of victory last for only 10 or 20 minutes.\"</p><p>Monk does not appear to be selling this gig and yet he maintains that it is worth it. Doing it all for his club of 10 years, the one that he loves, might possibly give him the edge.</p><p>\"Probably the biggest advantage I have is the fact that I've sat with those players,\" he says. \"I know how they think, what they've been talking about and what they want in terms of training and playing. You have to try to use that to your advantage.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/435300724|2014-05-04T13:19:43Z|cae0198fdf62c9ce4eac24f953b7ee794034a5c2 -->",

The instant call to Paul Scholes, a creative midfielder of the highest class for the club, to assist on the training pitch illustrates there will be no concern about who United are facing: it is to be all about Giggs telling the side to go out and force themselves on the opposition, starting with Norwich City this weekend.</p><p></p><h2>2 Be adaptable </h2><p>\"I think you've got to be natural as much as you can as a manager, find your own style, not try and be somebody else,\" Giggs says. \"Different people have different characteristics. So you have to be adaptable and maybe not be: 'I'm going to play like this.' You evolve really.\"</p><p>The 40-year-old said that this month when on a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/22/ryan-giggs-philosophy-coaching-management-moyes-manchester-united\" title=\"\">pro-licence course</a> and it will be intriguing to analyse the teams he puts out in his four matches in charge.</p><p>Moyes's management showed few signs of flexibility. The well-documented disagreements with Rio Ferdinand, Danny Welbeck, Tom Cleverley, Ashley Young and Chris Smalling – to name but a few – the attritional training methods disliked by the squad and his public gaffes suggested a man unable to learn from mistakes and change on the hoof. His predecessor, Sir Alex Ferguson, enjoyed 26 years of success precisely because he could, to use Giggs's word, \"evolve\".</p><p></p><h2>3 Pick himself?</h2><p>Giggs may not be the solution to the one of the Premier League's hoariest conundrums – the glaring hole in the United midfield – but he was certainly underused by Moyes. In this could be seen the Scot's sometimes baffling logic. Why start the Welshman for the campaign's biggest matches, the home outing of the Champions League last-16 against Olympiakos as United trailed 2‑0 and versus Bayern Munich in the next round's corresponding leg – but only on 12 other occasions?</p><p>Marouane Fellaini's £27.5m failure (so far, at least),  Cleverley's below-par displays, Darren Fletcher's recent recovery from serious illness and Michael Carrick's weariness as the sole A-list central-midfielder, all made a case for him to be utilised more. So will he write the name of Ryan Giggs on his first team-sheet? He was asked this   and refused to give a definite answer, although he did admit he \"hadn't decided yet\" what he will be wearing, a suit or tracksuit, making it more likely he'll be on the sidelines, at the start at least.</p><p></p><h2>4 Man-management </h2><p>The sight of anyone in a United shirt this term appearing at ease has been a collectors' item. From Robin van Persie – team-mates are \"occupying the spaces I want\" – down, barely hidden disgruntlement has been the default mood. \"Play with a smile on your face\" is a cliched management trope precisely because of the simple wisdom that footballers should take to the field forgetting what could be lost while striving for what can be gained. Easier said than done, of course. Yet the handling of multi-millionaires with a clutch of medals is perhaps a No1's most vital skill. Can Giggs do better here than Moyes? Put bluntly, he will struggle to do worse.</p><p></p><h2>5 Harness <strong>the </strong>Old Trafford atmosphere </h2><p>\"We don't see ourselves as underdogs. We see ourselves as Manchester United playing at home in the Champions League.\" So said Giggs before the Champions League quarter-final opening leg against Bayern. In this moment a season of deferential football that has left the club embarrassingly off the pace was swept away and the real United were restored.</p><p>But the problem for fans pining for more was that Giggs delivered these words as a player. Under Moyes' management, the team continued to cause discontent with their dire home displays and record.</p><p>Three of United's last four matches are at Old Trafford. As a bona fide legend of the club, the atmosphere when Giggs sends out his XI promises to be spine-tingling.</p><p>It all starts  with the visit of Norwich.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/435300432|2014-05-04T13:19:43Z|0351825ceee18bf7a88aa16c5d3a9a96afc6ab3f -->",

In the meantime, here's what Ren&eacute; Meulensteen, one of the coaches who left after David Moyes took over at Old Trafford, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/24/david-moyes-manchester-united-rene-meulensteen\">has had to say for himself on the past week's saga</a>:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>Meulensteen described it as &quot;too crazy for words&quot; that Moyes had left United seventh in the Premier League, 23 points off the top, and blamed it on Ferguson's successor trying to make too many changes too quickly. &quot;You have to look at Manchester United and the job that David Moyes took on,&quot; he said. &quot;United were a very successful team, with many successful years behind them. The strategies in place worked. But David ignored the advice that was given to him by many of the staff in place at the time.</p><p>&quot;He opted to put his own plans in place, which he was perfectly entitled to do, but I think it backfired on him. I always strongly believe the performances and the results are a reflection of what is actually happening behind the door and that wasn't good enough, as simple as that.</p><p>&quot;Don't forget David was a respected manager in the Premier League who worked for 11 years at Everton in a very good way. But I did warn him: 'Do you realise, after everything at Everton, you're going from a yacht to a cruise liner? That's how big the difference will be.' It's not just necessarily the work on the pitch. It's everything that surrounds Manchester United, the players, the performances, the pressure, the style, the identity. And I think he underestimated that. It's always easy in hindsight but unfortunately it's cost him his position.&quot;</p></blockquote> </div> </div><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/435292623|2014-05-04T13:19:43Z|0a8c3ab6328fd80cd53eb35a87dfbe9617f904ac -->",

The 40-year-old is still to retire as a player but will assume managerial responsibilities against Norwich on Saturday.</p><p>And, when asked by MUTV on Friday if he had considered turning down the offer, he said: \"When Ed asked me to look after the team for the remaining four games, I had no hesitation in saying yes. I've got to say this is the proudest moment of my life. The club has been the biggest part of my life since I was 14.</p><p>\"I'm proud, happy, a little bit nervous, but just like I am as a player, I can't wait for the game on Saturday. I can't wait for 5.30 tomorrow when we walk out at Old Trafford. I know the place will be rocking. I've told the players: 'I trust you and I know what you're capable of. Go out there and show it.' \"</p><p>Of United's dismal campaign under Moyes, Giggs said: \"It's been a frustrating season. We win together and lose together and in these remaining four games, I want to bring the positivity back.</p><p>\"We have three games at Old Trafford, where the home form hasn't been great, and I want to see goals, tackles, players taking players on and getting the crowd up. I want the passion that should come with being a Manchester United player.\"</p><p>Giggs even joked about himself as a player. \"I've just given myself a five-year contract.\"</p><p>Moyes left United seventh in the  Premier League, 23 points behind the leaders Liverpool. Moyes was dogged by rumours – always denied by the Scot – that he did not have a good relationship with his players. \"I'd like to thank David for giving me my first chance in coaching,\" said Giggs, who was appointed first-team coach when Moyes arrived. \"It was something I'll always remember when he rang me in the summer and asked me to come on board. Obviously I was still playing but he's given me my first opportunity of a coaching role.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/435296445|2014-05-04T13:19:43Z|8966d7f8edca9951b3f3850e6f13a31d1d0b1a0a -->",

        "headline":"Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekend",
        "body":"<h2>1) Can Norwich spoil demob-happy United's party?</h2><p>Poor old Norwich City, desperate for points, and facing a preposterous run-in: Liverpool, Manchester United, Chelsea, Arsenal. It couldn't get any worse. Except, yes, yes it could. Because they now travel to United with the home team feeling good about themselves pretty much for the first time in a season. The home fans want a show, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/22/david-moyes-sacked-manchester-united\" title=\"\">Ryan Giggs wants a job</a>, so the players have been ordered to rediscover their lust for life and ping it about accordingly, in the time-honoured United way. Given that Norwich have picked up fewer points on the road than any other side, they seem ill equipped to poop this particular party. Unless, unless. United haven't responded particularly well to hard, relentless pressing this season, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/20/norwich-city-liverpool-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Norwich managed to put the wind up Liverpool last weekend</a> by doing exactly that. A long shot, but a repeat performance of that staunch second-half display at Carrow Road could be enough to scramble an invaluable point, especially if Norwich find their hosts a touch too demob happy. <strong>Scott Murray</strong></p><blockquote><p>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/23/manchester-united-edinson-cavani-cesc-fabregas\" title=\"\">United set sights on Cavani</a><br />• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/24/david-moyes-manchester-united-chosen-one-banner-removed-oldtrafford\" title=\"\">'The Chosen One' banner removed</a></p></blockquote><h2>2) Liverpool can't risk playing for a draw at Chelsea</h2><p>A draw should be enough. Crystal Palace may be one of the form teams in the division, but with Liverpool in this mood it seems unlikely the final two games of the season will hold much fear for Brendan Rodgers' side. So a point against Chelsea and the title will head to Anfield for the first time since 1990. And that should be a good thing – the pressure is eased, no need for Liverpool to attack <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/23/chelsea-jose-mourinho-liverpool-atletico-madrid\" title=\"\">José Mourinho's probably weakened team</a> and leave themselves open on the counterattack. And yet, there's a nagging sense this might be dangerous. Liverpool have been so superb going at teams, ripping them apart from the off, throwing caution to the wind. Defence is certainly not their strong point, Rodgers must certainly know that. But with only a point needed, for the first time this season the temptation will be there for the players, not just the manager, to protect what they have from the off – and that could leave them open to a classic Chelsea snatch-and-grab. Despite all the pre-match bluster, a Mourinho side isn't just going to lie down and hand the title to Liverpool, any deviation from the Reds' tried and trusted method could prove a fatal error and allow Manchester City to sneak in at the death. <strong>Toby Moses</strong></p><blockquote><p>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/24/luis-suarez-premier-league-title-surprised-liverpool-players\" title=\"\">Title bid has surprised players, says Luis Suárez</a><br />• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/23/chelsea-jose-mourinho-rui-faria-ramires-charged\" title=\"\">Chelsea trio charged over Sunderland incidents</a></p></blockquote><h2>3) Everton have little to fear at St Mary's </h2><p>St Mary's has gained a reputation as one of those Tough Places To Go, though Southampton's recent home form has been a touch erratic. Setting aside a 4-0 victory over Newcastle United, who gave up competitive sport some time ago, their last few performances on their own patch haven't been up to much. A 2-2 draw with Stoke. A 4-2 win over Norwich during which they flirted with embarrassment by nearly shipping a three-goal lead. A 1-0 defeat by struggling Cardiff. In fact their best home performance of recent times came against Liverpool, a match they rather unfairly lost by three goals, having been much the more incisive team for nigh on an hour. Everton, by comparison, have won eight in nine, and their last three away, and are desperate for another three points which would keep their Champions League hopes alive. They will be strong favourites against a side whose momentum this season was wantonly jiggered the second Mauricio Pochettino handed in that ludicrous teamsheet at Sunderland in the FA Cup. <strong>SM</strong></p><blockquote><p>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/24/roberto-martinez-david-moyes-bounce-back-manchester-united-sacking\" title=\"\">Everton desperate for fourth, says Martínez</a><br />• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/23/manchester-united-edinson-cavani-cesc-fabregas\" title=\"\">United favourites for £30m Luke Shaw</a></p></blockquote><h2>4) Palace can thrive on City tension</h2><p>When these two teams met in December, Manchester City had just registered back-to-back home victories over Arsenal (6-3) and Liverpool (2-1). Crystal Palace were the next visitors to the City of Manchester Stadium and, while they lost the game pretty much as expected, proved a tougher nut to crack than either of City's two fellow title contenders, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/dec/28/manchester-city-crystal-palace-premier-league\" title=\"\">Edin Dzeko scoring the only goal midway through an increasingly tense second half</a>. Palace took succour from that performance then, as they famously launched one of the most comprehensive Great Escapes of recent years. And they'll take succour from it now, especially as they're second in the recent form table, while City by comparison have never been quite the same since <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/29/arsenal-manchester-city-premier-league\" title=\"\">Arsenal came at their throats during the second half at the Emirates last month</a>. Palace have earned the right to play with freedom, but City can't afford a slip in the title race, and their mood will depend on whether José Mourinho did a number on Liverpool at Anfield. So they'll either be depressed or overly excited, then. Expect another tense battle. <strong>SM</strong></p><blockquote><p>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/apr/24/crystal-palace-tony-pulis-premier-league-survival\" title=\"\">How Tony Pulis turned Crystal Palace around</a><br />• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/24/manchester-city-liverpool-title-race-pablo-zabaleta\" title=\"\">City have not given up on catching Liverpool, says Zabaleta</a></p></blockquote><h2>5) Hull need three more points to be safe</h2><p>After the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/12/fulham-norwich-city-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">1-0 win against Norwich</a> Fulham looked like upsetting the odds and scrambling to safety. Then they lost <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/19/tottenham-hotspur-fulham-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">3-1 at Spurs</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/19/chelsea-sunderland-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Sunderland secured a stunning win against Chelsea</a>, to make the Black Cats everyone's tip to avoid the drop. It's a topsy turvy world at the bottom of the Premier League. Even Hull on 36 points can no longer be 100% sure of survival if the bottom three keep up the fight, and with one eye on the FA Cup final Steve Bruce cannot afford to get complacent. If Fulham win here they are three points behind Hull with winnable games against Stoke and Palace to come for Felix Magath's side. Norwich may look like a lost cause, but it's not inconceivable that one of Cardiff or Sunderland will reach the 37 points needed to overhaul Hull. West Brom and Villa are the other teams beneath City – both of whom are capable of clambering above them. Bruce's side have a game in hand on those above – but that's away at United, a match that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/22/david-moyes-sacking-manchester-united-manager-brutal\" title=\"\">no longer seems such a gimme</a>. Fourteenth in the league, it would be easy for the players to lose focus, but one last effort, and three points, would give them plenty of time for rest and recuperation before the final without the pressure of having to look over their shoulder at the chasing pack. <strong>TM</strong></p><blockquote><p>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/22/yannick-sagbo-fined-quenelle-hull-city\" title=\"\">Yannick Sagbo fined £15,000 over <em>quenelle </em>support</a><br />• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/18/asgkan-dejagah-felix-magath-fulham\" title=\"\">Dejagah says Magath is the man to keep Fulham up</a></p></blockquote><h2>6) Lambert finds grass isn't greener at Villa Park</h2><p>Paul Lambert's nearly at the end of his second season at Aston Villa and what has he accomplished? The wage bill may be less, but he took over with the club having finished in 16th place on 38 points, managed to lift them to 15th last season, and 41 points, and now looks set to match the 16th/38-point total of his predecessor, the much-maligned Alex McLeish. It's hardly been a rousing success. No wonder then that Randy Lerner seems to have tired of his play thing, with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/20/aston-villa-southampton-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">an announcement on his future involvement at the club due at the season's end</a>. This, coupled with the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/16/paul-lambert-suspensions-chairman-backing-aston-villa\" title=\"\">suspension of his key lieutenants</a> seems to indicate that the end may be nigh for Lambert as he takes his team to face Swansea City, and he'll leave with his reputation nothing but tarnished by his two-year stint in Birmingham. What could have been had he stuck it out at Norwich, who he guided to 12th in 2011-12, and then finished 11th under Chris Hughton the following season? It's not hard to imagine, with the funds available to Hughton at Carrow Road, Lambert may have taken the Canaries to new heights and garnished his then very impressive CV, putting himself in the frame for less thankless jobs, rather than watching nervously over his shoulder as Norwich seemed doomed to head back down to the Championship. Loyalty is something demanded of players by fans, but nobody questioned the logic of Lambert swapping Carrow Road for Villa Park – two years later that decision looks decidedly less wise. <strong>TM</strong></p><blockquote><p>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/20/aston-villa-southampton-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Lerner refuses to deny that he is set to sell Villa</a><br />• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/18/staying-up-five-players-premier-league-survival\" title=\"\">Staying up: five players with big say in survival</a></p></blockquote><h2>7) Europa League reward</h2><p>The Europa League is the butt of many a joke. It's the tournament everybody seems to want to avoid playing in – with many citing Liverpool's failure to qualify for it last year as a key advantage in this season's title race. So perhaps Spurs would be better off throwing this match at Stoke and allowing Ryan Giggs to lead United to a glorious sixth-placed finish? But hold your horses cynics – Uefa are putting a halt to all this Europa League nay-saying by offering a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/apr/24/pep-guardiola-bayern-munich-champions-league-real-madrid\" title=\"\">Champions League place for the winner from next season</a>. Sadly they are not stopping the horrible practice of dumping Champions League group stage failures into the knockout stages, but beggars can't be choosers, and at least it gives sides like Tottenham a tangible, non-silverware related reason for trying their hardest in the competition. With expected spending sprees at United, Arsenal and Liverpoool, as well as the continued opulence of Chelsea and City, the top four is going to become even further away for Spurs, no matter who they get to replace Tim Sherwood. It may be that next season their best chance of reaching the Champions League riches will come from the competition they've so frequently bemoaned, so Tottenham can't afford to let United slip past them into sixth. <strong>TM</strong></p><blockquote><p>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/18/tim-sherwood-tottenham-hotspur\" title=\"\">Sherwood admits his Spurs team are 'much of a muchness'</a><br />• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/21/gay-football-fan-groups-equal-rights\" title=\"\">Gay fan groups take lead on equal rights</a></p></blockquote><h2>8) Mel needs wins to keep his job</h2><p>West Brom are another of those sides who looked like they could maintain their Premier League status <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/mar/28/west-brom-two-wins-in-20-games-not-relegation\" title=\"\">more by default than any great results on the pitch</a>. That seems less likely now, with the gap to the relegation zone just three points and a trip to the Stadium of Light still to come. Pepe Mel's appointment was designed to lift them clear of this sort of worry, but instead they've remained rooted just outside the relegation places, with the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/02/saido-berahino-legal-action-james-morrison-west-bromwich-albion-dressing-room-row\" title=\"\">squad more concerned with fighting each other than the opposition</a>. Mel seems almost certain to depart at the end of the season, come what may, but if he's to have any chance of staying in his job then retaining their Premier League status as others slip up will probably not be enough. Wins at home to West Ham on Saturday and Stoke on the last day of the season are a must to give the Baggies' season an air of respectability. <strong>TM</strong></p><blockquote><p>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/gallery/2014/apr/22/pepe-mel-the-gallery\" title=\"\">Pepe Mel | The Gallery</a><br />• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2014/apr/24/sam-allardyce-manchester-united-sacking-david-moyes-video\" title=\"\">Allardyce criticises sacking of David Moyes – video</a></p></blockquote><h2>9) Arsenal's confidence as brittle as their players </h2><p>After the disappointing defeat to Palace, Everton got back on track with their <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/20/everton-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Moyes-dooming win against United</a> last weekend, and with the Blues kicking off against Southampton early on Saturday, the pressure may well be back on Arsenal to win to regain fourth spot. Suffice to say handling pressure is not something Arsène Wenger's team have coped with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/feb/08/liverpool-arsenal-premier-league\" title=\"\">all</a> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/22/chelsea-arsenal-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">that</a> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/dec/14/manchester-city-arsenal-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">well</a> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/06/everton-arsenal-premier-league-report\" title=\"\">this season</a>. Luckily it's a home game against a Newcastle side that seem to have stopped performing since Alan Pardew returned following his stadium ban. With Aaron Ramsey returning to the form that would surely have seen him nominated for player of the season had he stayed fit, and Mesut Özil back pulling the strings, Arsenal look well-equipped to reclaim the fourth-place trophy they've made their own. But these final few games have added importance beyond securing Champions League riches. Arsenal are very much a confidence team, hampered away from home against the better sides by their own lack of belief moreso than a lack of ability. If they really are to break the trophyless spell on 17 May against Hull at Wembley it feels like a run of wins will be as important to the players as the return of their injured stars. <strong>TM</strong></p><blockquote><p>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/23/newcastle-strengthen-squad-summer-shola-ameobi\" title=\"\">Shola Ameobi: Newcastle must strengthen squad</a><br />• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/22/football-transfer-rumour-mill-arsenal-goncalo-guedes\" title=\"\">Football transfer rumours: Arsenal to sign Benfica's Guedes</a></p></blockquote><h2>10) Mannone and Marshall hold clubs' futures in their hands</h2><p>Positive results for both Cardiff and Sunderland last weekend mean that this game has the feeling of a relegation playoff – a draw does nobody any good, a win for either side could condemn the other to Championship football next season. Neither can afford any stupid mistakes, so having two of the season's most impressive goalkeepers in place must help their managers to sleep at night. Vito Mannone may have <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/16/manchester-city-sunderland-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">slipped up against Man City</a>, but his form has been a rare bright spot on the long list of signings made by Paolo Di Canio on Wearside. The Italian did not always convince when playing for Arsenal, but he rarely let them down and clearly had the respect and affection of his team-mates, who dubbed him 'Buffon'. David Marshall may have impressed the pundits, with many touting him as the goalkeeper of the season (although <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/apr/24/louise-taylor-premier-league-team-of-season\" title=\"\">not our very own Louise Taylor</a>), but Mannone's 5.20 saves per match measure up well against the Cardiff keeper's 4.21 – that seems a fairer measure of the pair than simply goals conceded given the porous nature of both team's defences. A couple more clean sheets from either of them may well be enough to save their team – although should they cancel themselves out here it'll be Hull, Villa, West Brom and Norwich celebrating on Sunday afternoon. <strong>TM</strong></p><blockquote><p>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/19/jose-mourinho-referee-chelsea\" title=\"\">Mourinho furious at officials after Sunderland defeat</a><br />• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/18/david-marshall-relegated-cardiff-city\" title=\"\">Marshall determined to save Cardiff from relegation</a></p></blockquote><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/435257832|2014-05-04T13:19:43Z|5cb0c2282bf81d2c5bc65fa6f620a1520cae2a2d -->",

        "body":"<p>David Moyes has been accused of \"ignoring the advice\" of more experienced Manchester United staff and making a series of fundamental mistakes because he did not realise that leaving Everton to replace Sir Alex Ferguson was like \"going from a yacht to a cruise liner\".</p><p>René Meulensteen, one of the coaches who left after Moyes took over, said Ferguson's successor had only himself to blame <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/22/david-moyes-sacked-manchester-united\" title=\"\">for being sacked</a> because he had \"under-estimated\" the size of the job at Old Trafford.</p><p>Meulensteen described it as \"too crazy for words\" that Moyes had left United seventh in the Premier League, 23 points off the top, and blamed it on Ferguson's successor trying to make too many changes too quickly. \"You have to look at Manchester United and the job that David Moyes took on,\" he said. \"United were a very successful team, with many successful years behind them. The strategies in place worked. But David ignored the advice that was given to him by many of the staff in place at the time.</p><p>\"He opted to put his own plans in place, which he was perfectly entitled to do, but I think it backfired on him. I always strongly believe the performances and the results are a reflection of what is actually happening behind the door and that wasn't good enough, as simple as that.</p><p>\"Don't forget David was a respected manager in the Premier League who worked for 11 years at Everton in a very good way. But I did warn him: 'Do you realise, after everything at Everton, you're going from a yacht to a cruise liner? That's how big the difference will be.' It's not just necessarily the work on the pitch. It's everything that surrounds Manchester United, the players, the performances, the pressure, the style, the identity. And I think he underestimated that. It's always easy in hindsight but unfortunately it's cost him his position.\"</p><p>Meulensteen believes Moyes's first mistake was to bring in so many coaching staff from Everton, a decision that eventually persuaded the Dutchman to leave the club. \"It became very evident to me after a few meetings with David Moyes that he wanted to bring in his own people and do it his own way,\" he continued. \"I felt very strongly that things would change dramatically for myself and the position I held so I didn't feel there was a good foundation to carry on.\"</p><p>He added: \"It's too crazy for words. I've been part of Manchester United's backroom staff for the last five years for Sir Alex Ferguson and the last five years have been proven to be the most successful in the history of Manchester United. Now they've had a poor season, they have dropped to seventh, out of the Champions League and suddenly, after so many years of constant success, we're now asking whether Manchester United are good enough to get in the top four. To me, there should be nothing else and that's probably why the decision has been made because they want to be back [in the Champions League] and next year they want to be challenging for the league title.</p><p>Meulensteen, speaking on SiriusXM FC, backed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/22/ryan-giggs-philosophy-coaching-management-moyes-manchester-united\" title=\"\">Ryan Giggs's appointment as interim manager</a> but believes there will have to be an extensive rebuilding process in the summer. \"Five, six, seven players [have to be changed] and that's too much … that is the challenge the club are facing in the summer but I still think United have a fantastic squad and with the right additions can be a force very quickly.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/435267732|2014-05-04T13:19:43Z|bb2a1e44a12f89bcbe3aff1ba742fe966626c909 -->",

        "body":"<p>Nicky Butt has stated it will be a proud moment for Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes, Phil Neville and himself, when they take charge of Manchester United for  visit of Norwich City.</p><p>Butt, the club's youth team coach, is assisting Giggs, who is the interim manager in the wake of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/22/david-moyes-sacked-manchester-united\" title=\"\">David Moyes' sacking,</a> while Neville has been retained from the Scot's backroom staff and Scholes has also been drafted in to help.</p><p>All four joined the club as youngsters, and Butt said: \"It will be massive for us, a proud moment for all. To be there together is a bit of a surreal thing. We walked in here together when we were 12 and to be here now – I'm not 40 yet but Giggsy is, and myself and Scholes are nearly there too. So for us and Phil to be there together is a very proud moment.\"</p><p>With Giggs due to speak morning for the first time since being given the post until the end of the season, Butt said the aim was to try to win the last four matches. The defending champions are currently in seventh place.</p><p>\"We're here to try to help the club and get the results that we want from now until the end of the season,\" said the former midfielder. \"What happens after that, who knows? We've got some amazing players at this club, good lads who care about the club, who are really positive about United and want the best for the club.</p><p>\"Saturday is a massive occasion, not only for Ryan, but for the staff, the fans and the players as well because they know that we've underachieved as a club this year. The players in that changing room know how good they are. They look round, look left and look right at the players next to them and know that they are very proud, hard-working lads. I'm sure we'll see that.\"</p><p>Eric Harrison, the coach who developed the so-called Class of '92 youth team who also featured David Beckham and Gary Neville, has admitted he thinks the decision to sack Moyes was correct. \"I feel sorry for David Moyes and I don't want to be critical but there is no question that the spirit was missing,\" he told the Manchester Evening News. \"The bond wasn't there. That old atmosphere had gone.</p><p>\"I watched the game at Everton [which United lost 2-0] and it was dreadful. I don't think the players were playing for the manager or themselves. It looked like they wanted to go elsewhere.</p><p>\"That kind of feeling doesn't appear to have been there for months. But the fact is now that people like Ryan Giggs, Nicky Butt and Paul Scholes will revive the excitement and atmosphere. The training ground will be buzzing and so will Old Trafford against Norwich City.\"</p><p>Giggs, Butt, Scholes and Neville leading United means a lot to Harrison. \"I am so proud and it is a great move by the club after the difficult season everyone has endured,\" he said, before claiming all can be a success in their respective roles. \"I can smell the good coaches out and certainly of this trio you could tell they would have it in them to have careers on that side. Scholesy is obviously perceived as the quiet one and generally he was off the field but on the pitch he could be vocal. He won't be a manager but as a coach I always thought he could transfer what he could do on the pitch to the training ground.</p><p>\"I used to get the lads in my office once a week one by one and have a chat with them. I remember telling Scholesy at one point that he would definitely make it to the first team and I have never seen a face like it. It was unbelievable. He was so happy. I think he appreciated that quiet word and I think he will bring that to the training ground. He'll be giving the little private pep talks. He's done a bit with the under-19s and with Oldham Athletic's youngsters and I am convinced the respect he will have at United will ensure people listen to him.</p><p>\"Ryan and Nicky are different personalities to Paul but they are all sensible, mature men and what players. The experiences they have to call on and pass on is immeasurable. It might not be long term at United, who knows? But I do know they will all be top coaches one day somewhere.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/435258586|2014-05-04T13:19:43Z|6a7556bb36acc5079293b2f69b99df165a40c4ad -->",

        "body":"<p>Nicky Butt has admitted it will be \"a proud moment\" for him when he takes his place on the Manchester United bench for Saturday's meeting with Norwich City.</p><p>The former United midfielder, together with Paul Scholes, has been brought in as an assistant to interim manager Ryan Giggs in the aftermath of David Moyes' sacking on Tuesday, having previously spent time as reserve team manager. Phil Neville has also been retained as a coach having worked under Moyes, meaning four of the fabled \"Class of 92\" will be on the bench on Saturday.</p><p>\"It will be massive for us, a proud moment for us all,\" Butt told MUTV.</p><p>\"To be there together is a bit of a surreal thing. We walked in here together when we were 12 and to be here now – I'm not 40 yet but Giggsy is, and myself and Scholes are nearly there too. So for us and Phil to be there together is a very proud moment.</p><p>\"We're here to try to help the club and get the results that we want from now until the end of the season. What happens after that, who knows?\"</p><p>Having lost to Everton on Sunday in Moyes' last match, United still have an outside chance of finishing in sixth spot but go into the Norwich game trailing Tottenham by six points. Butt is confident that all the players will be keen to see out the final four games of a frustrating campaign on a positive note.</p><p>\"We've got some amazing players at this club, good lads who care about the club, who are really positive about United and want the best for the club,\" he said.</p><p>\"Saturday is a massive occasion, not only for Ryan, but for the staff, the fans and the players as well because they know that we've underachieved as a club this year.</p><p>\"The players in that changing room know how good they are. They look round, look left and look right at the players next to them and know that they are very proud, hard-working lads. I'm sure we'll see that on Saturday.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/435250467|2014-05-04T13:19:43Z|9b21691d5d6cf65c44a805a6b23e3237e657d86a -->",

        "body":"<p>The David Moyes era at Manchester United ended on Tuesday and now the \"The Chosen One\" banner has been removed from Old Trafford.</p><p>Placed at the Stretford End at the start of the season as a show of support for the man who replaced Sir Alex Ferguson, the banner was mimicked last month when a group of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/27/manchester-united-plane-message-david-moyes-sacked\" title=\"\">supporters arranged for a flypast with the message \"Wrong One – Moyes Out\"</a> during the victory against Aston Villa.</p><p>It has been removed before Saturday's  match against Norwich, when Ryan Giggs will take charge of his first match since being named as the interim manager. The <a href=\"http://www.stretfordendflags.com/\" title=\"\">Stretford End Flags</a> group, who paid for the banner and are planning a new mural in tribute to Sir Bobby Charlton, are still undecided what to do with it. \"It's something we're going to think about carefully. We may offer it to the National Football Museum or auction it off for charity,\" the co-founder Andrew Kilduff <a href=\"http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/manchester-united-chosen-one-banner-7027207\" title=\"\">told the Manchester Evening News</a>.</p><video data-media-id=\"gu-video-435238184\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">\n        <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/04/24/140424Allardyce-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/04/24/140424Allardyce/140424Allardyce.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/04/24/140424Allardyce_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/04/24//140424Allardyce.webm\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/04/24/140424Allardyce_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source>\n      </video><p>\"It got a lot of coverage but there are no regrets about it. Old Trafford is filled with symbolism so there is no hiding place for a manager.\"</p><p>A spokesman for the National Football Museum appeared to rule out any possibility of exhibiting the banner: \"While we are always grateful for offers, we often have to decline for reasons of space and because it doesn't fit within our guidelines.\"</p><p>A bid of £154,000 for a spoof listing of the 20ft banner was also registered on eBay, although the genuine \"David Moyes is a football genius\" banner displayed by Liverpool fans at Old Trafford last month went for £500.</p><p>Moyes has been advised to take some time out of football while he recovers from the disappointment of being sacked after only 51 games in charge. \"I wouldn't advise him to come back into the game sooner,\" Sam Allardyce, the West Ham United manager said. \"I would come back later if I were him. He has done 15 years continuously. To take some time with the family and reflect and enjoy life a little bit more without the pressures of particularly Premier League football will do him the world of good. When he emerges again, he will come back a better manager than he already has been, and he has been one hell of a manager.\"</p><p>The Norwich manager Neil Adams, who took over at Carrow Road two weeks ago following Chris Hughton's sacking, is unsure whether Moyes' departure, and the subsequent boost that Giggs' appointment will give United, will be a help or hindrance on Saturday. With Norwich's Premier League status not yet secured, Adams says his players must focus on their own jobs and not be affected by what has happened at Old Trafford.</p><p>\"Obviously, I'm very sorry for David. It's never nice when managers lose their jobs,\" Adams said. \"I'm not too fussed over what time it's come. We've just got to deal with it.</p><p>\"There will be a lot of speculation – is it beneficial for us? Is it going to be a hindrance? It is what it is. We're playing a good team, with good players who have probably not done as well as they would've liked this season, hence what's happened this week. You're naturally going to see a reaction. The crowd will be up for it.</p><p>\"Ryan Giggs is a huge fans' favourite at Man United, he's won everything there is to win at domestic level, and he's one of the best players the club has had. Naturally there's going to be a reaction from that. It's something we've prepared for and have to be ready for.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/435230887|2014-05-04T13:19:43Z|30fc53c8853080b45e1e35fd06bec47221ca68ae -->",

        "headline":"Manchester United set sights on Paris Saint-Germain's Edinson Cavani",
        "body":"<p>Manchester United intend to plough ahead with their transfer business during the potentially long process of waiting for a new manager to start – almost three months in Louis van Gaal's case – and their extensive inquiries include exploring the possibility of whether Paris Saint-Germain might sell Edinson Cavani.</p><p>United confidently expect to close a deal of around £30m for Luke Shaw, offering the teenage Southampton full-back a lucrative financial package that could be worth as much as £100,000-a-week over five years. The offer will be difficult for Chelsea to match bearing in mind their issues over keeping in line with Uefa's financial fair play rules. Ed Woodward, United's chief executive, has been made aware that Cavani might be available and is also tempted to look again at Cesc Fábregas's position at Barcelona, despite the unsatisfactory way it turned out when they tried to sign him last summer.</p><p>Although United were accused of handling the process badly at the time, the club remain convinced that Fábregas was keen to join them only for the proposed move to break down because of the politics and sensitivities that surround his association with Barcelona. Their interest is sustained in part because Robin van Persie, Fábregas's close friend, has reported that the former Arsenal midfielder wanted the move to happen, using the striker as an intermediary, and Woodward was told exactly the same by the relevant agents.</p><p>United failed with bids of £25m and £30m, as well as making a verbal offer in the region of £35m, and could not persuade Fábregas to go public or try to force the issue. This time they will approach it more cautiously but, again, with the sense that both Fábregas and Barcelona are more open to the idea than their public utterances might lead people to suspect.</p><p>What is increasingly clear is that United realise they will have to spend significant sums of money if one of Van Gaal or Carlo Ancelotti, the two managers uppermost in their thoughts, is to repair the damage that was caused in the David Moyes era. The team, who are out of next season's Champions League, lie seventh in the Premier League, 23 points off the top, and are about to be deposed as champions.</p><p>Woodward is confident that two deals have already provisionally been put in place, though those names have not been revealed. Their interest is known in several high-calibre players such as Marco Reus and Ilkay Gundogan at Borussia Dortmund, Toni Kroos at Bayern Munich and Sporting Lisbon's William Carvalho.</p><p>Chelsea were considered favourites to land Shaw, a lifelong Chelsea supporter whose parents live near the club's Cobham training centre in Surrey. Yet the terms plus the lure of becoming Patrice Evra's instant successor at left-back have boosted confidence at Old Trafford that the 18-year-old England prospect will join, becoming the highest paid teenager in English football.</p><p>The priority for United is in midfield, as well as finding replacements for the departing Nemanja Vidic and Rio Ferdinand, but United have already held preliminary talks to ascertain whether Cavani might be prised away from PSG. The fee would be high, potentially £60m for a 27-year-old, in complete contrast to the policy that existed at Old Trafford a few years ago whereby the club simply would not countenance, post-Dimitar Berbatov, paying huge amounts for a player of that age.</p><p>Cavani signed from Napoli for £52.7m last summer, making him the sixth most expensive player in the world. His introduction to Ligue 1 was hugely impressive at first but the Uruguayan's form has diminished in the second part of the season and he was unable to exert any real influence in either leg of the Champions League quarter-final against Chelsea.</p><p>Although United are not short of forwards, the reason for their interest is two-fold. First, there is a recognition at Old Trafford that the team have lacked dynamism and need an injection of directness and pace in attack. Second, Woodward wants to bring a superstar to the club and his ambition of bringing Cristiano Ronaldo back to Manchester seems a long way away.</p><p>Whoever takes over from Ryan Giggs – who will hold his first press conference as interim manager on Friday – will be involved in the process as soon as it becomes possible. In Ancelotti's case, the earliest that could happen would be the end of May. However, United have to establish the chance of him leaving Real Madrid and a lot depends on how his team finish the season.</p><p>For Van Gaal, it would be even longer, as he prepares to take Holland to the World Cup finals. United, deliberating between the two, intend to make their first approaches in the next two weeks.</p><p>The debate over Adnan Januzaj's international future appears to have been settled after the Belgium coach, Marc Wilmots, took to Twitter to announce the teenager has committed himself to the land of his birth. The 19-year-old – who was born in Brussels to Kosovar-Albanian parents – is eligible to play for up to five countries, with Turkey and England also believed to have registered an interest. However, with Belgium preparing to take part in their first World Cup finals since 2002, Wilmost has confirmed that Januzaj will be avaialble for selection in Brazil.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/435174243|2014-05-04T13:19:43Z|b922232c61b2c45fae97a8f60bf17b5a70069346 -->",

        "body":"<p>The Glazers will fly in to Manchester to meet Ed Woodward on Friday for discussions with the executive vice-chairman about who is to replace David Moyes as United's manager.</p><p>Led by Joel Glazer, with whom Woodward talks on a daily basis, the owners want to ensure a clear strategy is established regarding how to pursue their prime target, thought to be Louis van Gaal.</p><p>With the Holland coach taking up official duties on 7 May at a training camp for Netherlands-based players, Van Gaal and the Dutch Football Association have stated that any action regarding his post-World Cup future should finish before then so that he can concentrate on the tournament.</p><p>Van Gaal has been clear that if this does not occur he is content to wait until mid-July, when the tournament ends and his contract expires, to find a club. Woodward is aware of the 7 May deadline and believes that if Van Gaal is to be the prime target a deal for him to take over after Brazil 2014 can be signed off and announced before then.</p><p>Woodward will discuss this and other potential candidates, who include Real Madrid's Carlo Ancelotti, with the Glazers, along with transfer strategy.</p><p>The Glazers are thought to want a more hands-on role in finding Moyes's successor than last year when they allowed Sir Alex Ferguson to choose the Everton manager as his replacement.</p><p>Woodward was in Madrid on Wednesday to see the Champions League semi-final first leg between Real Madrid and Bayern Munich. It is not known if he planned to meet Van Gaal, who is at his holiday home in Portugal, before returning home. The Irish Examiner has reported that Van Gaal would like Roy Keane, the former United captain and current Republic of Ireland No2, as his assistant if he takes the job.</p><p>The Glazers will also see Ryan Giggs, United's caretaker manager, on Friday to wish him luck for Saturday's visit of Norwich City and for the subsequent final three matches of the season.</p><video data-media-id=\"gu-video-435238184\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">\n        <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/04/24/140424Allardyce-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/04/24/140424Allardyce/140424Allardyce.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/04/24/140424Allardyce_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/04/24/140424Allardyce_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/04/24//140424Allardyce.webm\"></source>\n      </video><p>Moyes took a parting shot at United's players by stating the squad requires \"fundamental rebuilding\" on a day when the League Managers Association chief executive, Richard Bevan, claimed the manager's sacking was done unprofessionally.</p><p>Moyes was told he would be removed early on Tuesday morning at United's Carrington training complex. Yet he believes he was treated in a shabby manner as news of his probable removal broke in the media on Monday afternoon.</p><p>Moyes chose to focus on the failings of the squad and it was notable no thanks were offered to the players. \"We were fully focused and committed to the process of the fundamental rebuilding that is required for the senior squad. This had to be achieved while delivering positive results in the Premier League and the Champions League.</p><p>\"However, during this period of transition, performances and results have not been what Manchester United and its fans are used to or expect, and I both understand and share their frustration.</p><p>\"To have been appointed as manager of Manchester United, one of the biggest football clubs in the world, was and remains something of which I will always be incredibly proud.\"</p><p>Bevan said: \"The LMA is very disappointed with the nature of David's departure from Manchester United and to read extensive reports in the press, confirming David's sacking, before David himself had been spoken to officially by the club.</p><p>\"Throughout his time at United, David, as he always does, has conducted himself with integrity and professionalism, values that he believes in and that have been strongly associated with the club and its rich tradition. It is therefore sad to see the end of David's tenure at United being handled in an unprofessional manner.\"</p><p>In response, United said. \"We do not accept that it was handled in an unprofessional manner. The decision was not taken until late Monday night and was communicated face-to-face first thing on Tuesday morning. When reports started emerging on internet news sites on Monday afternoon, no decision had been taken at that time.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/435177238|2014-05-04T13:19:43Z|214ffab7c1d322f19d8f9fb8265302fa095f4ffb -->",

        "body":"<p>David Moyes has taken a parting shot at Manchester United's players by stating the squad requires \"fundamental rebuilding\", while the League Managers Association chief executive, Richard Bevan, has claimed the manager's sacking was done unprofessionally.</p><p>Moyes was told he would be removed early on Tuesday morning at United's Carrington training complex. Yet  he believes he was treated in a shabby manner as news of his probable removal broke in the media on Monday afternoon.</p><p>Moyes chose to focus on the failings of the squad and it was notable no thanks were offered to the players.</p><p>\"To have been appointed as manager of Manchester United, one of the biggest football clubs in the world, was and remains something of which I will always be incredibly proud,\" Moyes said. \"Taking charge after such a long period of continuous stability and success at the club was inevitably going to be a significant challenge but it was one which I relished and never had a second thought about taking on.</p><p>\"The scale of the manager's job at United is immense but I have never stepped away from hard work and the same applies to my coaching staff. I thank them for their dedication and loyalty throughout the last season.</p><p>\"We were fully focused and committed to the process of the fundamental rebuilding that is required for the senior squad. This had to be achieved while delivering positive results in the Premier League and the Champions League. However, during this period of transition, performances and results have not been what Manchester United and its fans are used to or expect, and I both understand and share their frustration.</p><p>\"In my short time at the club I have learnt what special places Old Trafford and Carrington are. I would like to thank the United staff for making me feel so welcome and part of the United family from my first day. And of course thank you to those fans who have supported me throughout the season. I wish you and the club all the best for the future.\"</p><p>Bevan said: \"The LMA is very disappointed with the nature of David's departure from Manchester United and to read extensive reports in the press, confirming David's sacking, before David himself had been spoken to officially by the club.</p><p>\"Throughout his time at United, David, as he always does, has conducted himself with integrity and professionalism, values that he believes in and that have been strongly associated with the club and its rich tradition. It is therefore sad to see the end of David's tenure at United being handled in an unprofessional manner.\"</p><p>In response, United said. \"We do not accept that it was handled in an unprofessional manner. The decision was not taken until late Monday night and was communicated face-to-face first thing on Tuesday morning. When reports started emerging on internet news sites on Monday afternoon, no decision had been taken at that time.\"</p><p>Moyes will take some time to reflect but intends to seek another position at some point. \"I have always believed that a manager never stops learning during his career and I know I will take invaluable experience from my time as United's manager,\" he said. \"I remain proud to have led the team to the quarter-finals of this year's Champions League and I remain grateful to Sir Alex Ferguson for believing in my ability and giving me the chance to manage Manchester United.\"</p><p>Paul <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/paul-scholes\" title=\"\">Scholes</a>  has been added to Ryan <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/ryan-giggs\" title=\"\">Giggs's</a> backroom staff, with the 39-year-old helping the interim manager run Wednesday morning's training session.</p><p>Scholes is helping Giggs along with Nicky Butt, the youth team coach, and Phil Neville and Chris Woods, the two members of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/david-moyes\" title=\"\">Moyes</a>  's backroom staff who have remained.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/435168750|2014-05-04T13:19:43Z|0e3ac261ee2b5a7e23a272bcf7c6d7530f97335b -->",
