        "headline":"Maria Miller: just another departure through the revolving door at DCMS",
        "body":"<p>There was one dreadful hole in the profusion of punditry last week. What does Maria Miller's abrupt departure mean for culture, media and sport? Answers, please, alongside a detailed assessment of her contribution to coalition policymaking, on a very small postcard. And cough with due embarrassment before saying: \"Not much.\"</p><p>Yet \"not much\" it is and very little it will probably remain for the next 13&nbsp;months as her successor, Sajid Javid, basks in golden opinions (\"The first of Thatcher's children has arrived\": Tim Montgomerie, the <em>Times</em>) and prepares, along the way, to be the first son of a Pakistani bus driver who may (or may not) become our prime minister.</p><p>For the difficulty – one that afflicted Mrs Miller just as surely as it will leave Mr Javid twiddling his thumbs – is that&nbsp;the DCMS isn't much of a department. Basically, it takes money (well over a billion from lottery and Treasury) and distributes it to dozens of quangoid organisations who reach their own conclusions about how to spend it. Just \"a funnel\", says Philip Collins in the&nbsp;<em>Times</em>.</p><p>We're here \"to help make Britain the world's most creative and exciting place to live, visit and do business\", says the requisite mission statement, linking \"artistic heritage\", community \"growth\" and \"fantastic tourism\" in a bumper bundle that also protects \"deeply held beliefs on freedom and equality\" in \"the global race for economic success\". All of which sounds, on examination, rather like the scenario for a new series of <em>W1A</em>.</p><p>Miller didn't have to make challenging speeches, so she didn't. Nor, whatever the conspiracy theorists may think, was she truly in charge of any power-tinged processes. Leveson and the royal charter? A wheeze cooked up by Oliver Letwin in the Cabinet Office and implemented in a dazed rush by David Cameron – and whatever Westminster says, it's dead in the water until way past the general election. The BBC's licence fee? Foisted on a hapless director general by the PM himself last time around and sure to be clutched to the bosom of Downing Street yet again come 2016. Plurality and the menace of Sky? BT has seen that one off <em>pro tem</em>.</p><p>Secretaries of state at culture (and national heritage before that) organise consultations, supervise appointments, commission reports, go to Covent Garden. But they don't organise the Olympic Games. That's Seb Coe's triumph. They don't run the arts. That's Arts Council business. Nor the big issues of broadcasting. Call for&nbsp;Ofcom.</p><p>They may be allowed a few little wheezes of their own. Jeremy Hunt sought to kickstart 50 or so local TV stations. They may harbour grand ambitions for broadband in an interconnected world. But there have been 12 cabinet culture supremos in 22 years, a shuffling, shifting trickle of talent passing through. There's no day-to-day function they perform that couldn't be farmed out to No&nbsp;10, business, the Home Office, health and more. The British Museum, the Churches Conservation Trust and the Horserace Betting Levy Board don't fit under the same umbrella – let alone jostle in any global race for economic&nbsp;success.</p><p>Javid may be as remarkable as his friends proclaim. He's certainly formidably numerate and Treasury-trained. But anyone who expects to see him happy to remain as top dog at 100&nbsp;Parliament Street in 13 months' time is seriously deluded. And wan thanks to Miller, plus all her outraged headlines, for making the point. Empty vessels generate the most noise.</p><p>■ No one of any weight, from Michael Gove to Sajid Javid to the editor of the <em>Times</em>, thinks her ministerial Leveson link is what sunk Maria Miller. An irritant with a special adviser itch, perhaps, but nothing more. Half-a-million outraged tweets after that cursory non-apology did far more damage.</p><p>Yet there is one fundamental factor here that both politicians and press ought to ponder. Simply, that they don't just stand on different barricades, waving their fists, because they can't agree about charters, independent regulators and sundry rulebooks. They're on a different sides because that's where they're supposed to be, caught in constant fusillades of charge, counter-charge.</p><p>Of course that's not a stupid game to be pursued willy-nilly; sometimes only cynicism and destruction follow in train. It is, though, basic positioning – and one great reason why even perfect regulation will never guarantee perfect peace.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/434303675|2014-05-03T00:12:40Z|bb4888652d97ef256d19858cf15526a816cc9647 -->",

        "body":"<p>A lobbyist who oversaw his company's BSkyB account during Rupert Murdoch's attempt to gain control of the broadcast and telecoms firm has been appointed as a special adviser to the government minister for competitiveness.</p><p>James Wild led media operations at the lobbying firm Hanover, where he oversaw the BSkyB account. Last month, he joined the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) as an adviser to the business minister, Michael Fallon.</p><p>A second Hanover employee, Nick King, who is understood to have been briefed on details of BSkyB's lobbying operation, has been appointed as a policy adviser for the Department of Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) by the culture secretary, Maria Miller, in the last month.</p><p>The moves have raised fresh questions about the closeness between the Conservative party and the Murdoch empire, just months after a DCMS special adviser resigned over an inappropriately close relationship with a News Corporation public relations employee.</p><p>The Labour MP Chris Bryant, a vocal critic of News Corp, said: \"It seems the revolving door between the Conservatives and News Corp is still well oiled and in regular use. How can we be confident that these people won't be opening up yet&nbsp;another back channel to News Corp and News International as the government decides how to respond to the Leveson report?\"</p><p>Wild's appointment was unusual because most ministers who are not secretaries of state do not take on special advisers.</p><p>A DCMS spokesperson said: \"It is ridiculous to suggest the department has, or would, give any company favourable access in policy-making or decision-taking.\" The BIS had nothing to add on behalf of Fallon.</p><p>Wild joined Hanover as an account director in 2009 to boost growth in the firm's communications sector, such as its BSkyB and 3 mobile accounts. A press release from the time quotes him as saying: \"BSkyB and 3 are incredibly exciting businesses and I was attracted to Hanover because of its excellent reputation in the comms sector.\"</p><p>Before moving to Hanover, Wild worked in the research department for the then shadow Tory trade and industry ministers Angela Browning and David Heathcoat-Amory.</p><p>While the DCMS is responsible for broadcasting and telecommunications, BIS has responsibility for competition, corporate governance, business law and business support.</p><p>BIS oversees the enterprise and regulatory reform bill, which includes measures to establish the Competition and Markets Authority and abolish the Competition Commission and the Office of Fair Trading. The bill includes powers to amend the Competition Act 1998 and the Enterprise Act 2002, as well as measures relating to copyright.</p><p>In a statement, Wild said: \"While in my previous role, I never met ministers nor their officials in relation to BSkyB – indeed I stopped working on the account more than a year ago.</p><p>\"In my new role I am bound by the government's code of conduct for special advisers and any relevant interests are declared in the normal way.\"</p><p>Wild did not respond to questions about whether he would excuse himself from competition matters due to come before Fallon that might involve BSkyB.</p><p></p><p>King joined Hanover in May and had previously worked in the research department at Conservative central office from 2009 to 2010, covering culture, media and sport issues.</p><p>A spokeswoman for King said he knew of the account \"in the same way that he knew about many of Hanover's broad array of clients\", but he did not lobby any politicians or civil servants on BSkyB's behalf.</p><p>\"Hanover has a very wide range of clients, of which BSkyB is one,\" she said.</p><p></p><p>• This article was amended on 14 November 2012. The original said Michael Fallon oversees the enterprise and regulatory reform bill. This has been corrected.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/399328934|2014-05-03T00:12:40Z|d85182d69ad4e74e5762c815114d40d5459324b5 -->",
