Quite how put out you are by that ineluctable truth is a matter of personal taste. You may in fact find it very palatable that the former <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united\">Manchester United</a> titan will regard himself as entirely unbesmirched by the sorry saga which on Tuesday saw his chosen successor find his desk in the lift. Or you may wish fervently that a chastened Ferguson were sitting right now in a luxury hotel room, crying his humiliated little heart out, as Jos&eacute; Mourinho reportedly did after learning the United manager's job would be going to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/david-moyes\">David Moyes</a> in the first place.</p><p>But to adopt either position counts as what the pop psychologists would categorise as projecting. Something can only really be deemed embarrassing if there is an embarrassee, and to imagine that Ferguson is fundamentally questioning himself at this juncture is to misunderstand the man, and everything that experience should have taught those who had the opportunity to observe him for so long.</p><p>People don't change. And 72-year-old people change even less. You don't achieve the vast success that Ferguson did by taking long, agonising looks at yourself, whatever the self-help book industry pretends. Self-reflection is obviously required on occasion, but only as a function of self-interest: to enable the elimination of mistakes that are preventing the benighted from realising your primacy. Whether motivated by fear of failure or the desire to win, the victor's personality type requires the constant assertion of the self – a self in which one can only place the most fervent and unshakeable belief. As Ferguson himself stressed time and again in interviews during his managerial career: there is absolutely no room for self-doubt. And if there wasn't then, there certainly won't be now. He's just not wired for it.</p></blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/apr/23/sir-alex-ferguson-david-moyes\">More here</a>.</p> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-04-23T13:49:05.365+01:00\">at 1.49pm BST</time></p> </div> <div id=\"block-5357b5fde4b07a5858f68bcc\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-04-23T13:46:15.338+01:00\">1.46pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/34702957\"> <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/4164470\" title=\"View MorganFreechild’s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/discussion/avatars/2010/08/23/MorganFreechild/15c3c733-9a63-4788-b088-6103b09f73c0/60x60.png\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for MorganFreechild\" /> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> <div itemscope=\"\" itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/4164470\" title=\"View MorganFreechild’s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">MorganFreechild</span> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/34702957\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">23 April 2014 1:30pm</a> </div> <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"><p>Had a dream last night which featured the old National Lottery advert, but it was Fergie's giant finger pointing down from the stands saying in a deep voice 'It's Mou'. </p> <p>You can't argue with that evidence.</p></div> </div> </div> </figure> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5357b4d2e4b0b9e95f93eb91\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-04-23T13:41:52.594+01:00\">1.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p><b>Here is our chief football correspondent, Daniel Taylor, on the latest from the LMA and Moyes.</b></p> <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/DTguardian/statuses/458946083784491009\"> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Did the LMA criticise Sir Alex Ferguson, one of their own, for &quot;unprofessional manner&quot; in which he recruited Moyes behind Everton's back?</p>— Daniel Taylor (@DTguardian) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DTguardian/statuses/458946083784491009\">April 23, 2014</a></blockquote> </figure> <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/DTguardian/statuses/458946315532398592\"> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Ferguson tapped up Moyes and told him he had a new job - admitted by all - two days before Everton played a Merseyside derby</p>— Daniel Taylor (@DTguardian) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DTguardian/statuses/458946315532398592\">April 23, 2014</a></blockquote> </figure> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5357b3e0e4b07a5858f68bc8\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-04-23T13:38:25.582+01:00\">1.38pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p><b>&quot;The most appropriate Scooter song for Utd this coming year,&quot; reckons Niall Rowantree, &quot;is surely 'Back in the UK' from the 1996 classic album 'Our Happy Hardcore'.</b> After all they're not going to be in Europe.&quot; Classic album?

He has achieved such a lot in the game, he knows the club inside out and he must have every promising coach's number in his contact book, so what could possibly go wrong?</p><p>Apologies for the flippancy, but things have moved on a bit since the last coronation and United still do not appear to appreciate the seriousness of the new situation. They are still behaving as if Old Trafford is a dream destination, somewhere anyone in the managerial world would love to come and have a go, conveniently ignoring the actual nitty gritty of the club's reduced cirmcumstances. Nail a note to the front door saying &quot;Job available&quot; and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/louis-van-gaal\">Louis van Gaal</a> would still come knocking, so why the need for the nod from Ferguson?</p><p>Alternatively, what could Fergie dangle in front of Carlo Ancelotti as a carrot to come to Manchester? Never mind Gareth Bale, we've got Ashley Young? Why would a coach currently in charge of Real Madrid, in a Champions League semi-final and with an outside chance of a treble, be interested in an English club with American owners and mountains of debt, presently lying seventh in the table with no chance of European football next season?</p><p>Ancelotti may not be completely happy at the Bernabeu, few coaches ever seem to be, but if his side reach the Champions League final at Bayern Munich's expense he will be on the verge of one of the great managerial achievements. If they lose and things turn sour then fair enough, United might have a chance of securing a top manager, but it would still be a step down from Ancelotti's present level. The Italian could quite easily keep himself in employment at Champions League clubs for the rest of his career without having to accept the challenge of rebuilding a side to break back in.</p></blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/23/manchester-united-ferguson-theatre-of-dreams\">Finish reading this article over here</a>. </p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5357afb0e4b07a5858f68bbe\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-04-23T13:19:21.537+01:00\">1.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p><b>Magnusson has this to say below the line.</b></p> <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/34701513\"> <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/1431628\" title=\"View Magnusson’s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/discussion/avatars/2014/02/28/1431628/e211a189-22cc-48b8-bfac-43aeda8ba0c7/60x60.png\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for Magnusson\" /> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> <div itemscope=\"\" itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/1431628\" title=\"View Magnusson’s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">Magnusson</span> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/34701513\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">23 April 2014 1:05pm</a> </div> <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"><p>Very dignified speech from Moyes.

But United need to be aware that there were issues that precluded them being at the real top table of European giants – their location and relative under-investment in the squad – that have been exacerbated by the lack of Champions League revenue and a tarnished public relations image.</p><p>&quot;As a United fan, I can only hope that Woodward can take what is undoubtedly a top-class commercial mind and apply it to the market characteristics of the pantomime that is football management. Pragmatism needs to rule – Van Gaal in first and reiterate that we are, at heart, winners. But the thrust absolutely must be breaking the bank to bring in either Klopp or Guardiola, and appealing to their innate competitiveness and egotism, to convince them that either is the man to get this juggernaut back on the road.&quot;</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5357a531e4b07a5858f68baf\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-04-23T12:34:10.938+01:00\">12.34pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p><b>Here is a short video on what fans in Manchester reckon about all this jazz.</b> Enjoy.</p> <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2014/apr/23/manchester-united-fans-david-moyes-sacking-video\" data-show-ads=\"true\" data-video-id=\"2080845\" data-video-name=\"Manchester United fans' opinion divided on David Moyes's sacking – video\" data-video-provider=\"Reuters\" data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/4/23/1398250092434/Manchester-City-supporter-017.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-435129242\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/4/23/1398250079055/Manchester-City-supporter-007.jpg\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/04/23/140423ManUFans-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/04/23//140423ManUFans.webm\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/04/23/140423ManUFans_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/04/23/140423ManUFans/140423ManUFans.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/04/23/140423ManUFans_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source> </video> </figure> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-04-23T12:34:56.216+01:00\">at 12.34pm BST</time></p> </div> <div id=\"block-5357a358e4b07a5858f68bab\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-04-23T12:29:30.128+01:00\">12.29pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p><b>&quot;Lots of confident assumptions regarding Van Gaal's future&quot; says Paul Ewart.</b> &quot;Barcelona's potential need for a new manager my well queer the pitch.

United's performances have shown no signs of developing into something fluent and cohesive, and in modern football you no longer have three years to prove you can do this. Secondly, with no sporting director at United the onus is on the manager to decide transfers, and Moyes' record (the players he failed to sign, the failure of Marouane Fellaini and his inability to get the best out of Juan Mata) wouldn't instil confidence that he could do better with the investment needed in the summer. Finally, though you can live with some poor results if you can see signs of progress, there have been too many this season for a club of United's reputation with no positive indications of improvement.</p><h2>Step 2: Research</h2><p>Between the decision (apparently taken in February) and the deed there will have been a thorough analysis of both why the Moyes appointment failed and where they should go next. Realising they need a more professional and rigorous recruitment process this time, they'd take advice from a variety of sources and ally that with an understanding of what their goals are, in results and playing style, in the short and long term. They will research and select candidates based on that: whose profile matches what they want in terms of personality, leadership style, tactical nous, coaching skills, track record in the transfer market, the ability to draw attractive players and so on. In the absence of a sporting executive at Old Trafford, it would be interesting to know how they went – and are going – about the footballing side of this. And as most foreign coaches aren't generally involved in the transfer process, would United need to rethink their structure if they choose a foreign coach with no Premier League experience?</p><h2>Step 3: Contact</h2><p>This is the most delicate step and one that can make or break a club executive as well as a potential manager if it goes wrong. The research process will have generated a very short list and it's likely that those people, being the best around, are in other jobs. From my experience one wouldn't talk to their current employers at this stage so in most cases there would be a first contact or unofficial approach (usually through a trusted middleman so it can all be denied if needs be) either with the candidate or more typically, his representatives. There's no suggestion that United would do anything against the rules but generally speaking, it's why incognito, clandestine meetings occur out of the public eye in hotel suites with as few people as possible present; I have met managers under contract to other clubs in such situations. The ethics might be questionable but as an executive you want the best for your club so in a way it's your duty to try; managers want the best for their careers, so it goes on all the time in football.</p></blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/apr/23/manchester-united-manager-successor-david-moyes\">There are two more here.</a></p> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-04-23T12:15:20.428+01:00\">at 12.15pm BST</time></p> </div> <div id=\"block-53579d0de4b07a5858f68b95\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-04-23T12:00:44.971+01:00\">12.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/DTguardian/statuses/458762131337646081\"> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Very strange, and unusual, for Mourinho to bring Abramovich into it publicly.

Even Hughes, Sherwood and Pulis have claimed more points with worse squads than Moyes has since the New Year. With van Gaal, they'll have a manager that's worthy of of the club.

Diego Simeone, the Atl&eacute;tico Madrid coach, is also being considered but United are leaning towards a more experienced candidate and their initial discussions, involving Ferguson, have concluded that the job has come too early for Ryan Giggs, even if he exceeds expectations in his four games as interim manager.</p><p>Laurent Blanc has also been ruled out, despite Ferguson's close ties with the Paris Saint-Germain coach, and it has been made clear that the final say this time will belong to Woodward, supported by the United's American directors, rather than the most successful manager in the club's history.</p></blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/22/alex-ferguson-manchester-united-manager\">Continued here</a>.

One Scot passed the flame to his anointed countryman, exhorted the faithful to give &quot;the Chosen One&quot; time and emphasised the extent to which the club was not like any other.</p><p>The end, just 10 months after a smiling Moyes walked into Old Trafford clutching a six-year contract, was brutal and underlined the extent to which <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united\">Manchester United</a> can no longer differentiate itself.</p><p>Yet despite a widespread acceptance in the club's boardroom that it had erred by so hastily agreeing to Moyes's coronation by his predecessor, and in particular in ignoring the claims of the flamboyant <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/jose-mourinho\">Jos&eacute; Mourinho</a>, it has emerged that Ferguson will again play a key role as kingmaker in recruiting Moyes's replacement.</p><p>A spectacular fall from grace on the pitch – from first to seventh, playing dour football that is anathema to fans who feasted on success throughout the Ferguson era – will also lead to renewed scrutiny of the club's controversial US owners, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/the-glazer-family\">the Glazer family</a>, away from it.</p></blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/22/david-moyes-sacking-manchester-united-manager-brutal\">Continued here</a>.

        "body":"<h2>REMOVING ONE OF THE KNIVES IN HIS BACK AND RETURNING IT FROM WHENCE IT CAME</h2><p>It's been a whole day since Manchester United became the first professional football club in All History to sack its manager. The United Nations have dispatched crack engineering taskforces to all four corners of the world, with a brief to get the planet winched back up onto its normal axis within 24 hours, and further plans are afoot to get the globe spinning again by the end of the week, end of the month at the very latest. No progress has been made as the Fiver goes to press but neither is there any major panic yet, as the contingency plans look pretty good too, if there's anything in these reports about Louis van Gaal taking over at Old Trafford and appointing Roy Keane as his second in command. That would kickstart the spin again and then some, in doublequick time to boot.</p><p></p><p>Though that's not to say there aren't inherent risks in this back-up scheme. Scientists are concerned that combustible elements such as Van Gaal, Keane and Sir Alex Ferguson, when placed within close proximity of each other, could collide with catastrophic effect. Nobody is sure what dangerous chemical imbalance this would create but the Fiver is convinced we'd all be dust come October or November, the earth scorched, with only three survivors roaming o'er the barren landscape: Govan's answer to King Lear, ranting into a hole in the ground; a mute, wild-eyed pundit, staring without blinking into a hole in the ground; and a tall, irritable figure standing in front of the pair of them, screaming in the style popularised by Klaus Kinski, demanding they take a look at his goddamn trouser arrangement, which he has balanced here on the platform of his hand for easy perusal, or to hell with them, for they are no better than pigs, worthless, spineless pigs.</p><p></p><p>But we get ahead of ourselves. In the meantime, with the planet stopped still and the UN engineers on their tea break, the always proactive David Moyes has spotted the opportunity to do what everyone else did on social media on Monday afternoon, and Have His Say. &quot;To have been appointed as manager of Manchester United, one of the biggest football clubs in the world, was and remains something of which I will always be incredibly proud,&quot; began a statement in which he thanked his coaching staff, United's backroom employees, Ferguson and the club's fans - but signally not the players who, like the aforementioned UN taskforce, have of late taken to downing tools.</p><p></p><p>Removing one of the knives in his back and returning it from whence it came with a jaunty twist, Moyes took special care to point out that &quot;fundamental rebuilding ... is required for the senior squad&quot;. Having offered his successor some beneficial advice, he gave a valedictory wave - &quot;I wish you and the club all the best for the future&quot; - before signing off with a defiant flourish. &quot;I have always believed that a manager never stops learning during his career and I know I will take invaluable experience from my time as United's manager,&quot; ran a barely disguised assurance that his managerial career is not quite finished yet. What price, then, his coming back to Old Trafford next season with another Premier League club and finally putting paid to that dismal personal away record against the big boys? If the UN engineers or the Van Gaal/Keane combo can't get the Earth rotating once more, such a result would certainly get things moving again with a pretty sharp bang.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE TONIGHT</h2><p></p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football\" title=\"\">Follow Real Madrid 1-2 Bayern Munich with Jacob Steinberg's minute-by-minute report at 7.45pm</a>.</p><p></p><h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2><p></p><p>&quot;Not all the players are ready to play for Manchester United, especially in defence and midfield.

We aren't going to rush and do the wrong things in his individual programme.&quot;</p><p></p><p>The former Internazionale owner Massimo Moratti has been staring wistfully into the distance and wonder what might have been if he had not dished his dosh on the Special One rather than mere players. &quot;I often think that it would be better to take back Jos&eacute; instead of buying so many players,&quot; he rued, wiping away some dust that got into his eye.</p><p></p><h2>STILL WANT MORE?</h2><p></p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global/blog/2014/apr/23/old-trafford-ferguson-moyes-manchester-united-tragedy\" title=\"\">Old Trafford was once a Theatre of Dreams but now setting for a tragedy</a>, melodramatics Russell Brand.</p><p></p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/apr/23/manchester-united-manager-successor-david-moyes\" title=\"\">Tor-Kristian Karlsen has put together a handy five-point plan</a> that Manchester United can use to appoint their new manager and you can use to pass off as your own ideas to impress your buddies down the boozer.</p><p></p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/apr/23/sir-alex-ferguson-david-moyes\" title=\"\">The sorry saga of David Moyes won't shake Sir Alex Ferguson's self-belief</a>, spot-ons Marina Hyde.</p><p></p><p>Have you ever wondered about the night that Juanito kicked Lothar Matth&auml;us in the face and hoped that someone like Scott Murray would write a 1408 word blog about it? <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/apr/23/real-madrid-bayern-munich-juanito-kicked-matthaus\" title=\"\">Your luck is in</a>.</p><p></p><p>Oh, and if it's your thing, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/guardianfootball\" title=\"\">you can follow Big Website on Big Social FaceSpace</a>.</p><p></p><h2>SIGN UP TO THE FIVER (AND O FIVER&Atilde;O)</h2><p></p><p>Want your very own copy of our free tea-timely(ish) email sent direct to your inbox?

Yet the terms plus the lure of becoming Patrice Evra's instant successor at left-back has boosted confidence at Old Trafford that Shaw will join.</p><p>Evra, 33 next month, was considering leaving in the close season but the Frenchman is now minded to stay. Shaw has been informed of this and that Evra would be happy to act as his mentor.</p><p>Shaw's rise to prominence has been so rapid that he could go to the World Cup in Roy Hodgson's England squad at the cost of Ashley Cole, who has 107 caps and was first-choice until Everton's Leighton Baines ousted him.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/16/luke-shaw-future-southampton-manchester-united-city-chelsea\" title=\"\">As reported by the Guardian</a> Shaw wants his future to be decided before the World Cup and the sense at United is that he will become their first major signing of the summer.</p><p>The sacking of Moyes is also causing many players who might have left in the summer if he was still the manager to consider staying. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/20/danny-welbeck-unhappy-future-manchester-united-moyes\" title=\"\">Danny Welbeck had decided he wanted to depart</a> owing to differences with Moyes. Now, the striker is minded to stay and other players, including Shinji Kagawa, Javier Hernández, Rio Ferdinand, Tom Cleverley, Darren Fletcher and Ashley Young, believe they will be offered a fresh start under Moyes's permanent replacement.</p><p>Despite United now having only an interim manager in Ryan Giggs, the club believe Moyes's departure has not affected their hopes of prising Toni Kroos from Bayern Munich.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/435142715|2014-05-04T13:20:47Z|ccfafbd782a4241d15b7f4c12699d0f1c5662c15 -->",

        "body":"<p>David Moyes's face has now experienced the fate for which it looks like it was designed. The deep grooves of grief in his brow, his sunken, woeful eyes and dry parched lips, a perspicacious sculpture carved in anticipation of this slap of indignity.</p><p>Sir Alex Ferguson's selection of the \"chosen one\" now looks less like John the Baptist heralding Christ and more like what I would do if invited to select my ex's next partner; the mendacious dispatch of a castrated chump to grimly jiggle with futile pumps upon Man United's bone-dry, trophy-bare mound. Moyes, a name that, let's face it, sounds like a Yiddish word for eunuch, has endured 317 days of celibacy, while Everton, his former paramour under the beguiling matador Roberto Martínez, are, likely to claim the final Champions League place.</p><p>Old Trafford, once the theatre of dreams, is now the setting for a tragedy of unfulfilled expectations. The Glazers must've expected that they were getting a wee, ginger, fledgling Ferguson; Moyes surely imagined that the great day had come after years of stability and prudence at Goodison Park, frugally guarding the Toffees, he was finally to be given the reins of the all-conquering devils. The expectations of the United players I query. Perhaps a dressing room of potent alphas for decades rendered beta, shackled by the Bordeaux-stained Uncle Joe, sensed that the new incumbent would not be so ferocious with the boot-kicking and the hair-drying and, like over-parented teens suddenly in the care of a clammy-palmed au pair, decided to kick up a bit of a fuss.</p><p>And now, from this truculent gaggle of malcontents, Ryan Giggs has emerged to lead United into the anti-climactic damp spasm that concludes this season of dismal failure. Giggs, whose untapped managerial prowess evaded Ferguson when he was asked to nominate a successor, the nearest approximation of an Anfield boot-room appointment considered instead to be the translucent Moyes, a pale imitation of himself, so pale in fact his impotent palpitations could be witnessed on a vascular level as United throbbed to a final flaccid loss at Goodison Park.</p><p>There is something ominous about the power shift that seems to be occurring as the two great, red dynasties of the north again appear to be exchanging destinies, the Liver bird once more upon its perch, the devils cast once more into hell. These cities locked in grievous conflict since the Mancs burrowed a canal to bypass Liverpool's docks, in the footballing deck these rival reds, the hearts of Liverpool and diamonds of Manchester, can never share the power.</p><p>In all likelihood Ferguson's immediate successor could never be more than a peppery sorbet to cleanse the palate after decades of glorious indulgence. Now the job of following Sir Alex is done and the far more favourable position of Moyes's heir is vacant. Any son of a great man knows a margin is required, some respite from the preceding magnificence. For a moment Manchester United, the board, owners, players and fans, were willing to yield so wholeheartedly to the myth of Ferguson's greatness that they believed he could endow with a benevolent swipe of his claymore, greatness upon his \"chosen one\".</p><p>Moyes's potency was dependent on Ferguson's patronage. It appears though that Ferguson's personal mythology superseded his tribal ties and he nominated not an heir who could carry on his legacy but one who would stumble and stoop and in so doing add greater emphasis to his own already staggering achievements. Perhaps Ferguson, the master manager and great socialist, recorded his only real failure subsequent to his tenure.</p><p>After all, what is it that we're cheering for on our sofas or in the stands? What causes the heart to soar and the eyes to tear? The players and managers move on when the time comes or the money goes. The chairmen and the boards drift with the Dow Jones, even the sanctity of the space, the pasture of the green cathedral can be turfed up and re-badged as Emirates or Etihad.</p><p>What is it then that is United? Who do we sing those songs for? In whose name do we curse or chant? It is the union itself that is sacred. Every single component of the game is a commodity. The players, the pitches, the shirts, the gel they put in their hair. But no one can pay me to support another team.</p><p>No oligarch can bring me to The Bridge or wring out the claret and blue from my veins.</p><p>Way down deep in our folk memory, deeper than the canal that bypassed Liverpool, deeper than the spilled blood between Millwall and West Ham or Celtic and Rangers, in a place we cannot name, in words that cannot be spoken, only sung, we know, we know that we are one. Great men leave and lesser men fall but the game, the game belongs to us all.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/435120711|2014-05-04T13:20:47Z|f59c691f113a676b2688fd7e7dad74da51a8c0b5 -->",

Diego Simeone, the Atlético Madrid coach, is also being considered but United are leaning towards a more experienced candidate and their initial discussions, involving Ferguson, have concluded that the job has come too early for Ryan Giggs, even if he exceeds expectations in his four games as interim manager.</p><p>Laurent Blanc has also been ruled out, despite Ferguson's close ties with the Paris Saint-Germain coach, and it has been made clear that the final say this time will belong to Woodward, supported by the United's American directors, rather than the  most successful manager in the club's history.</p><p>Ferguson will, however, still be an influential voice because the club consider it would be foolish to discount him, even though there is now an acceptance at boardroom level that he made a serious error of judgment choosing Moyes last year when José Mourinho was available.</p><p>United's directors have fleetingly discussed Mourinho's position at Chelsea but are also acutely aware that they would almost certainly be wasting their time trying to extract him from Chelsea and their attentions are on Ancelotti's position at Real Madrid and Van Gaal's availability after leading Holland at the World Cup. \"There is not a vast pool to choose from,\" a high-level source at Old Trafford admitted.</p><p>While it counts against Van Gaal that he would not be able to start until mid-July, the 62-year-old is still regarded as the leading candidate and has already let it be known he wants the job. However, it is not true that anyone from Old Trafford has already met him. The process of speaking to prospective managers will begin in the next couple of weeks and one of the reasons Moyes was removed now, rather than waiting until the end of the season, was that the club did not want to do it behind his back and risk the embarrassment of being caught in the way, for example, that happened with Manchester City in the changeover from Roberto Mancini to Manuel Pellegrini.</p><p>United now privately accept it was a mistake bringing in someone with Moyes' inexperience and believe it is mandatory the next manager has worked at the highest level. Simeone's record this season makes him difficult to ignore, although he is not a frontrunner. Jürgen Klopp has said he does not want to leave Borussia Dortmund and United intend to respect that position. Antonio Conte, the Juventus coach, has been learning English, with a desire to work in the Premier League, but has not featured prominently in United's discussions so far.</p><p>Ferguson has a good relationship with Ancelotti and was scathing of Chelsea when the Italian was sacked a year after winning the Double. Ancelotti's position might depend on how Madrid, third in la Liga and preparing for a Champions League semi-final with Bayern Munich, finish the season. His high salary would not put off United.</p><p>The decision to fire Moyes was taken in a conference call involving Woodward, the Glazers, Ferguson and the club's other directors on Sunday night, directly after the 2-0 defeat to Everton. The relevant people agreed to discuss the matter again on Monday rather than making an emotional decision but there was already a clear consensus that Moyes had to go.</p><p>Ferguson was asked for his opinion but it was made clear to him that his colleagues had already made up their minds. Most of the directors had lost faith  in Moyes in February and Woodward's opinion was that he could have been sacked, justifiably, any time over the last two months.</p><p>Moyes learned his fate when the story broke on various newspaper websites on Monday and is particularly unhappy about the way it was handled. He had a brief conversation with the club's press officer, Karen Shotbolt, but nobody in a senior position contacted him for the rest of the day.</p><p>Everything was confirmed when Woodward broke the news at the training ground and Richard Bevan, the chief executive of the League Managers' Association, was then invited to join them to discuss a compensation package.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/435080007|2014-05-04T13:20:47Z|f7a82eb6dcd396b15eccb9be7473cc45633833d2 -->",

        "headline":"David Moyes: a very brutal and modern sacking",
        "body":"<p>When David Moyes was unveiled as Sir Alex Ferguson's successor after 27 trophy-laden years at Old Trafford, the rhetoric was almost biblical. One Scot passed the flame to his anointed countryman, exhorted the faithful to give \"the Chosen One\" time and emphasised the extent to which the club was not like any other.</p><p>The end, just 10 months after a smiling Moyes walked into Old Trafford clutching a six-year contract, was brutal and underlined the extent to which Manchester United can no longer differentiate itself.</p><p>Yet despite a widespread acceptance in the club's boardroom that it had erred by so hastily agreeing to Moyes's coronation by his predecessor, and in particular in ignoring the claims of the flamboyant José Mourinho, it has emerged that Ferguson will again play a key role as kingmaker in recruiting Moyes's replacement.</p><p>A spectacular fall from grace on the pitch – from first to seventh, playing dour football that is anathema to fans who feasted on success throughout the Ferguson era – will also lead to renewed scrutiny of the club's controversial US owners, the Glazer family, away from it.</p><p>If the stakes were high a year ago, when rookie vice-chairman Ed Woodward said Moyes was \"cut from the same cloth as the Old Trafford greats who go before him\", now they are that much higher still.</p><p>Ryan Giggs, the playing legend employed as a coach by Moyes but estranged from him by the time the axe fell, will take charge for the final four matches of the season but will not get the job permanently. Instead, the Netherlands manager Louis van Gaal, Atlético Madrid's Diego Simeone and Real Madrid's Carlo Ancelotti are among the names on the shortlist.</p><p>In Germany, Bayern Munich's Pep Guardiola and Borussia Dortmund's charismatic Jürgen Klopp were quick to rule themselves out. Mourinho, who many feel would have jumped at the chance a year ago, is now at Chelsea. All told, it is a bit of a mess.</p><p>The Glazers' leveraged business model, estimated to have cost United £680m in interest and fees since they took over in 2005, requires consistent success on the pitch to keep the global sponsorship deals rolling in and the tills ringing. With season-ticket renewals due, and said to be disappointing, and a long-delayed £600m kit deal still in negotiation, the Glazers felt their hand was forced ahead of a make-or-break summer of transfer dealing in which they have promised –uncharacteristically – to spend big.</p><p>The club regularly trumpets new money-spinning sponsorship deals that crisscross the globe and claims to have a somewhat improbable 659 million \"followers\" around the world. But without success on the pitch to drive it, that financial model will start to creak.</p><p>The club's gloomy hierarchy decided in a short conference call after United's pathos-laden surrender to Moyes's former club Everton on Sunday that he must go immediately. A day of gathering rumours of his demise was followed by a terse Twitter statement on Tuesday morning. \"Manchester United has announced that David Moyes has left the club. The club would like to place on record its thanks for the hard work, honesty and integrity he brought to the role,\" it said.</p><p>If his unveiling was accompanied by flowery rhetoric about the club's glorious history and a \"commitment to the long term\", its termination was as messy, unsatisfactory and gloomy as the 10 months in between.</p><p>Moyes had already described how he had fretted about his attire when Ferguson initially invited him round to discuss the biggest job in English football and how the colour had drained from his face when he was offered it. If that lack of boldness rang alarm bells over his suitability for the job, by the end he was completely overwhelmed by it.</p><p>If it was a very modern sacking – the 10th of this Premier League season as clubs scrabble to retain their share of a new £5.5bn TV deal and maintain their position among Europe's elite to comply with Uefa's new financial rules – then the reaction was appropriately devoid of emotion.</p><p>A combination of \"player power\" as he lost support in the dressing room and self-fulfilling crisis propelled Moyes inexorably towards the exit. It is one that Gary Neville, the former United captain turned Sky Sports pundit, said he found distasteful. \"I don't like it, it's not the way in which the club should portray itself,\" said Neville. \"It's the modern world, it's how things seem to be dealt with now, but I'm a traditionalist and I think it could have been dealt with a whole lot better.\"</p><p>Moyes will depart with a substantial payoff, although the £5m he will receive was capped as a result of a clause that restricted him to 12 months' compensation.  But the money will do little to heal the wounded ego of a ferociously proud man whose reputation is unlikely to recover from his bruising Old Trafford experience.</p><p>One by one he lost the dressing room, the fans and the boardroom. Although, by modern standards, the match-going faithful had remained remarkably patient in the face of humiliating home defeats to neighbours Manchester City and Liverpool – United's bitter rivals who look to be on the way to their first title in 24 years.</p><p>It is to Anfield that United fans are casting worried glances as they consider the speed with which that club slipped from its perch following the glory days of the 1970s and 1980s.</p><p>As confidence in the team ebbed away and performances went from bad to worse, the Old Trafford hierarchy decided two months ago that they would have to abandon their rhetoric about putting in place a new dynasty and turn to the shortlist of elite hired guns who are habitually touted for the top jobs around Europe.</p><p>The only history that was being repeated was the farce of Wilf McGuinness's tenure after he replaced Sir Matt Busby in 1969. He too found that his predecessor, who remained a very visible presence around Old Trafford – just as Ferguson has been regularly pictured in the stands – cast a long shadow and he visibly wilted under the pressure.</p><p>Amid repeated calls for homegrown managers to be given a chance in the biggest jobs and for owners and chairmen to calm their itchy trigger fingers, the sacking of Moyes will reverberate loudly. It is unlikely a manager similarly untested in the top tier of European competition will again be entrusted with a big club.</p><p>It also leaves Paul Lambert at Aston Villa as the last remaining top flight representative of the once-proud Scottish managerial mafia who have delivered a rich seam of success at English clubs down the decades.</p><p>Unlike McGuinness, the increasingly haunted Moyes has also had to withstand the scrutiny of a 24-hour news cycle and judgment by social media which can be brutally unforgiving.</p><p>The more cynical believed that, far from being a romantic choice, Moyes had been recruited because he was a cheap option who would not rock the boat and maintain the Ferguson model with minimal fuss and investment. By the time it emerged that he was out of his depth and had been deserted by even his most fervent supporters within the club it was too late.</p><p>The wing of the United fanbase that has long campaigned against the Glazers, pointing to the hundreds of millions they have taken out of the club since 2005, were quick to seize on the sacking as evidence of a deeper malaise. The Manchester United Supporters Trust argued that it was only the managerial genius of Ferguson that papered over cracks in the squad caused by years of under-investment that has left them lagging behind European giants such as Real Madrid, Barcelona and Bayern Munich.</p><p>\"The club can only spend money that it has and, unfortunately, the club's owners have spent hundreds of millions of the club's money on financial restructuring and debt payments and this has limited funds available for investment in the playing squad,\" said Must's chief executive, Duncan Drasdo.</p><p>\"The quicker the owners realise that the club's current problems are underpinned by the ownership model rather than just the identity of the manager, the better.\"</p><p>In another reflection of the globalised nature of modern football, there was as much attention to United's share price on Wall Street as the effect on the playing staff. It rallied in early trading to its highest point since Ferguson announced his retirement in May, suggesting the decision to bring the curtain down on the Moyes era had at least found favour with investors.</p><p>But keen students of Manchester  United's history will also note that McGuinness, after a brief interregnum when Busby returned to steady the ship, was followed by Frank O'Farrell as the next full-time manager. He lasted less than 18 months.</p><p>• This article was amended on 23 April to correct some jumbled syntax.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/435079573|2014-05-04T13:20:47Z|d54268b0e6408685a02fadc8ac3eb97e45bc378f -->",

It is expected that Giggs will be assisted by Nicky Butt, the youth team coach, with Phil Neville and Chris Woods staying on from Moyes' coaching staff, meaning that Steve Round and Jimmy Lumsden will depart along with the Scot.</p><p>Giggs, as the most decorated player in United's history, will command the instant respect of the squad and, after 23 years at the club, has a full understanding of its ethos. Yet the board are intent on appointing a candidate with vast experience of elite management with Louis van Gaal, Carlo Ancelotti and Jürgen Klopp among the current favourites.</p><p>Moyes ultimately lost his job due to doubts among the board that he could draw the best performances from the elite players at his disposal. The<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/feb/25/olympiakos-manchester-united-champions-league-match-report\" title=\"\"> 2-0 Champions League loss at Olympiakos</a> on 25 February was the moment when serious reservations arose about Moyes' abilities, with the disjointed and aimless manner of his side's performances the chief concern then, and subsequently.</p><p>As displays continued in this disappointing style, the final straw proved to be Sunday's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/20/everton-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">2-0 loss at Everton</a>, after which the board began seriously discussing whether to sack Moyes, talks that continued into Monday. Once it was decided Moyes should depart the club were keen he should be informed straightaway.</p><p>The United hierarchy are confident that Moyes's departure will not affect their ability to buy players in the coming transfer market, following the debacle of last summer's window. While many targets have been identified along with their respective availability, there is a recognition that the new manager would need to be consulted.</p><p>Despite Van Gaal being the Holland head coach until his contract expires following the World Cup, this would not be a deal breaker in his potential recruitment.</p><p>However, it is also not an ideal position, and there is a realisation at the club that if a new permanent manager can be appointed in the near future this would help the sizeable process of rebuilding the squad over the summer. After Moyes was informed by Woodward he would be sacked, the club subsequently issued a statement. \"Manchester United has announced that David Moyes has left the club. The club would like to place on record its thanks for the hard work, honesty and integrity he brought to the role,\" it said.</p><p>Moyes then met with the players before training and a spoke in a dignified manner to them, with the occasion described as \"sombre\" and \"sad\" by some of those present.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/435074553|2014-05-04T13:20:47Z|42e6c31c9cc0f987df549bd437f695333c6261bd -->",

        "body":"<h2>YOU'RE JUST HAVING A BAD DREAM - GO BACK TO SLEEP</h2><p>The Fiver struggles over weekends: one can only play Minesweeper so many times in the 72 hours between 5pm on Friday and 5pm on Monday before the screws start to loosen. Imagine how we feel over a bank holiday: the wait between Thursday and Tuesday is excruciating. We're talking multiple existential crises. If a tea-timely email is sent from an office but it bounces straight back from every inbox, is it really sent at all? That kind of thing.</p><p></p><p>That's why, as we awakened from our self-induced coma on Tuesday morning, we were hoping for some big news. Maybe Tony Pulis was wearing a funny hat! But alas, there was nothing: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/22/sydney-fc-alessandro-del-piero-frank-farina\" title=\"\">just Alessandro Del Piero deliberating over whether he should keep playing for Sydney FC</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/22/david-moyes-sacked-manchester-united\" title=\"\">news that a mid-table Premier League side had fired their manager</a>.</p><p></p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/22/pep-guardiola-manchester-united-bayern-munich-no-chance Klopp\" title=\"\">But then! Pep! </a> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/22/jurgen-klopp-job-manchester-united-moyes-borussia-dortmund\" title=\"\">Klopp!</a> They spoke! Thank god for the Bundesliga – a shining beacon of newsworthy teams and managers, false neins and Philippe Lahm. But, and here's the thing, Pep and Klopp were talking about the Premier League. And even more strangely, they were talking about said mid-table Premier League side – one Manchester United – with the pair even having to deny any interest in the recently-vacated managerial position, which they did with all the yawning nonchalance of a parent calmly escorting their lost child back to their bed. \"No you can't jump in bed with Mummy and Daddy. You're just having a bad dream. Go back to sleep. You'll feel better in the morning,\" they didn't say.</p><p></p><p>Why any hack would ask why the managers of two German powerhouses – both set for another lucrative Big Cup campaign next season – would want to jump ship to Manchester in favour of looking after Ashley Young, the Fiver simply can't fathom. Ryan Giggs, 87, will have that job for the final four games after being tasked with filling the Moyes-shaped hole in United's dugout until the club gets its act together and chooses a non-Lord Ferg Chosen One.</p><p></p><p>\"My commitment to Borussia Dortmund and the people is not breakable\" Jürgen Klopp black-and-whited, while Pep Guardiola, sat in a La-Z-Boy recliner, announced that he was \"comfortable\" and that he is \"Bayern's and I want to stay here for [the] two more years [on my contract] to do my job.\" Hard luck for Manchester United, one can take only so much rejection – the Fiver should know.</p><p></p><p>While the United board isn't likely to want to wait two years for Pep, the Fiver is. If we can get through this slow news day, we can get through anything.</p><p></p><h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2><p>\"He will receive an ovation like he deserves because he is a hometown boy\" – Diego Simeone reckons Po' Fernando Torres may finally feel the love in tonight's Big Cup semi-final at Atlético Madrid. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football\" title=\"\">Follow Atlético Madrid 1-1 Chelsea with Jacob Steinberg's minute-by-minute report at 7.45pm</a>.</p><p></p><h2>FIVER LETTERS</h2><p>\"Re: Barry Glendenning is 'one of the four lucky Irish people who has made a life for himself in your country' (Fiver letters passim) I'm sure Barry is not concerned about the identity of the other three. More apposite is the fact that the internet now records written testimony that Mr Glendenning does indeed have a life. In your face haters!\" – Roger Mart.</p><p></p><p>\"Re Moyes, as the Rolling Stones once sang, You can't always get what you want but if you try sometimes well you might find you get what you need\" – Noble Francis.</p><p></p><p>\"I saw Darren Bent at the funfair in Battersea Park over the Easter break.

        "headline":"Ryan Giggs's winning mentality gives him edge at Manchester United",
        "body":"<p>Ryan Giggs used to play a little rugby league – the reason he was uprooted from South Wales to Manchester in the first place was because his father signed professional forms for Swinton in the 70s – so he is probably familiar with just how successful Wigan became a quarter of a century ago.</p><p>In the four years that the Australian coach John Monie was in charge, Wigan won the league and cup double four seasons running, an unprecedented level of dominance in almost any sport. When Monie stepped down in 1993, the Wigan chairman, Jack Robinson, knew he had a major problem in sourcing a replacement.</p><p>It was not that the job was unattractive – just the opposite – it was simply that having seen a ruthless winning mentality in action he had an idea how difficult it might be for someone else to step in and continue. \"All those coaches in charge of players who don't mind if they don't win anything don't know how lucky they are,\" he said once training-ground resistance had made life impossible for his choice of successor.</p><p>\"How do you go about finding the right person to deal with a dressing room full of world-class psychopaths?\"</p><p>Giggs might be a softly spoken yoga practitioner these days but he would understand the accuracy of that remark and its relevance to the Manchester United situation. Now that the stories of David Moyes being belittled for his Everton background and his inability to lay any medals on the table are beginning to emerge, it seems clearer than ever that Sir Alex Ferguson's choice was an inappropriate one, though Giggs more than most will grasp the reasons why.</p><p>To get the most out of his players, including winning the league by 11 points last season with a squad that has been variously described as ageing, unbalanced and inadequate, Ferguson must have built up the champion mentality to an almost deafening degree. You are Manchester United, this is what is expected. You are here because you can cope with the demands this club makes. Only special players can play for this club. Therefore you are special. You will not fail.</p><p>You need gravitas and a certain amount of scariness to get away with that, and if the story about Moyes asking Rio Ferdinand to watch a video of Phil Jagielka in action is true, he was sadly lacking in both.</p><p>It may not be true, because these things are often apocryphal and there was an almost identical story involving Bruce Rioch bringing Bolton training routines to Arsenal doing the rounds a couple of decades ago. But it sounds like it might be true, certainly true enough to survive in footballing mythology and perhaps be presented eventually in what David Peace might refer to as a version of the truth.</p><p>If the United players not warming to Moyes, and player-power in the form of some truly rank performances was what undermined his chances of a second season, Giggs is largely exempt from blame because the new manager  used him so sparingly.</p><p>Yet Giggs, as the senior pro, was never vociferous in his support for Moyes. At least one report had it that he was ready to walk away from the club at the end of the season, and United temporarily handing him the coaching responsibilities seems to indicate that they have come down on the side of the players instead of following Ferguson's blueprint.</p><p>In reality, they had little choice. Moyes was so obviously not the right fit it was plain a couple of months ago that he would not last the season.</p><p>There seemed little point in bringing in an interim manager from outside when United have only four games left and nothing important to play for, and Giggs was not only on the coaching staff but represents over 20 years of continuity from the Ferguson years.</p><p>So it is not quite the lunatics running the asylum, yet if United do manage a marked improvement in their remaining league games under Giggs it will lead to some awkward questions about why they were so unmotivated under Moyes.</p><p>Giggs has managerial ambitions of his own and while a little hands-on experience might not be a bad thing, it is doubtful whether he would have chosen to make a start at this club at this precise juncture. But then as every manager's favourite adage has it, clubs who are not in trouble tend not to be looking for a new man to take charge. Post-Moyes, that might now carry a rider: and look what happens when they do.</p><p>Giggs is already being told he would make an ideal permanent manager. Some pundits have even claimed he would have been a better appointment than Moyes a year ago, though mere popularity in the dressing room is no guarantee of success at one of the world's leading clubs. The whole point of the Moyes exercise was that Ferguson persuaded United not to take a gamble on a manager but to look to the long term and put something solid in place.</p><p>Moyes may not have won any trophies but he came with many years of managerial experience and United need to be careful of responding to his failure with a switch to short-term expediency. Giggs is the exact opposite of Moyes: short of experience but with trophies and medals coming out of his ears, though he will always be a bona fide legend at the club and someone every United player can look up to and respect.</p><p>While that is undoubtedly important in the immediate Moyes aftermath, the understanding is that United are now talking to prominent coaches around Europe and that once the season is concluded, a new man will come in and Giggs will be expected to take a back seat again. That already sounds problematic should United revive in the next few weeks. Is Giggs supposed to be doing an audition, or just holding the fort until reinforcements arrive? Would either party be happy were a new manager to come in and relegate Giggs to the sidelines once again?</p><p>Moyes was supposed to represent a clean break, which was why he was encouraged to be his own man and bring in his own staff. He has been crucified for that decision a thousand times since, yet the feeling last summer was that it would be a mistake just to keep everything going as Ferguson had it – the new man needed to assert his own personality at the club. Giggs has four matches  to do that, and as a non-newcomer he has a much better chance of succeeding than Moyes, yet like any coach or manager he needs to know the parameters of his position.</p><p>United know by now that breaks are rarely clean, however honourable the intentions. Giggs at the moment is an asset to United, not only still useful on the pitch at 40 but capable of unifying the club commanding support from players and fans alike. That sounds highly promising, unless you happen to be looking at the situation from the point of view of an incoming manager. While the post-Ferguson transition has moved into a different phase, it is far from over yet. What the last few months have proved is that the club, together with its most successful ever manager, is no different from any other. Mistakes can be made, and have been made, and might be made in the future.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/435062410|2014-05-04T13:20:47Z|67ec41fe23ad498ea16b5eaef03490f6b71b5b6c -->",

There's plenty of coverage of today's events – unfortunately <i>sans </i>playlist – about on the site.

But he was far from the only person culpable in a comedy of errors that has seen England's biggest club plummet from league champions to also-rans within 10 tumultuous months.</p><p>Moyes lost the players, the fans and - finally - the boardroom through an inability to show that he was making progress on the pitch. That forced the hand of the club's absentee owners as they contemplated a long overdue rebuilding operation and concluded the former Everton manager could not be trusted to oversee it.</p><p>In the end, they had no option. But it was as much their mistakes as those of Moyes that led them to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/22/david-moyes-sacked-manchester-united\">Tuesday's cursory announcement</a>.</p></blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/apr/22/david-moyes-sacking-alex-ferguson-glazers-ed-woodward-manchester-united?CMP=twt_gu\">You can read the whole of Owen's piece here</a>.

        "headline":"Who is to blame for Moyes' sacking: Ferguson, the Glazers or Woodward?",
        "body":"<p>Few could argue that David Moyes was not ultimately the architect of his own downfall. But he was far from the only person culpable in a comedy of errors that has seen England's biggest club plummet from league champions to also-rans within 10 tumultuous months.</p><p>Moyes lost the players, the fans and –finally – the boardroom through an inability to show that he was making progress on the pitch. That forced the hand of the club's absentee owners as they contemplated a long overdue rebuilding operation and concluded the former Everton manager <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/22/david-moyes-sacked-manchester-united\" title=\"\">could not be trusted to oversee it</a>. In the end, they had no option. But it was as much their mistakes as those of Moyes that led them to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/22/david-moyes-sacked-manchester-united\" title=\"\">day's cursory announcement</a>.</p><p>Peer through the blizzard of meaningless statistics (David Moyes has the second-highest win percentage of any United manager; David Moyes has the lowest points total of the Premier League era), past the memory of the haunted faces in the dugout and the ever louder whispers of discontent from the dressing room, and the reasons for the malaise at Old Trafford go far deeper than just one man.</p><p>In calculating the final cost of the end of an error – which will be measured in more than just points, pounds and pence – there are more than a few mitigating factors at play. Like a slow motion car crash, there has been an inevitability about the way the season has panned out since the summer.</p><p>The role of the club's inscrutable American owners, still reviled by large sections of their own fanbase for an ownership model that has cost the club more than £650m in fees and interest, will again come under the microscope. So too,  will that of vice chairman Ed Woodward.</p><p>The former investment banker was lauded as a commercial genius for minting the segmented overseas sponsorship strategy that allowed the Glazers to keep the tills ringing, service their debt and enjoy continued success on the pitch while Ferguson remained in post. So now he must accept the brickbats for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/aug/09/edward-woodward-manchester-united\" title=\"\">a catalogue of missteps</a> since taking over from David Gill in the top job last summer.</p><p>Sitting in his Mayfair office, Woodward once gave assurances that there was a well-considered plan tucked away in his desk drawer for when Ferguson's departure came. If that was ever the case, its execution left much to be desired.</p><p>And, of course, there is Ferguson himself. For all that the Glazers and the board erred in allowing him to effectively choose his own successor – a situation it is hard to imagine arising in any other major business – Moyes will go down in history as Ferguson's short lived \"chosen one\".</p><p>In <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2013/oct/22/sir-alex-ferguson-autobiography-10-things-we-learned-manchester-united\" title=\"\">his book</a>, Ferguson said Moyes would have \"no trouble embracing our traditions\" and said the Glazers were impressed by the fact he was a \"straight talker\". In both cases, the opposite proved to be true as his fellow Scot failed to embrace the club's attacking traditions on the pitch and cut an ever more impassive, beleaguered figure off it.</p><p>Whether on some unconscious level Ferguson chose a successor who he saw as the closest available facsimile of his own approach to life and management, or even one who would not immediately dismantle his empire as a José Mourinho may have done, is one for the psychologists. What is clear is that it suited the Glazers to position the appointment as Ferguson's choice alone.</p><p>For many fans, the culpability of Ferguson – the man who gave them 38 trophies in 28 years – runs deeper still. It was the Scot who defended the Glazer model to the hilt even as Old Trafford rocked to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/feb/28/manchester-united-green-gold-wembley\" title=\"\">\"green and gold\" protests</a> and insisted that the cash being paid out to service debts, that at one stage hit £716.5m and now stand at £356.6m, had not harmed his ability to compete in the transfer market.</p><p>One scene sums up United's desperate season and it speaks volumes that it features Ferguson rather than Moyes: the club's most successful manager being barracked in the stands by home fans during the humiliating home defeat <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/mar/25/manchester-united-manchester-city-david-moyes\" title=\"\">to neighbours Manchester City</a>.</p><p>Even as his managerial genius allowed him to wring the last drops of success out of an ageing squad, winning his final title <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2013/apr/23/manchester-united-premier-league-titles\" title=\"\">with a flourish</a>, it was clear that Ferguson had left his successor a stack of problems. Long term under-investment in the squad had left it threadbare and Moyes could be heard complaining about the hand he had been dealt as early as United's pre-season tour of Australia.</p><p>Those problems were undoubtedly exacerbated by the cack-handed handling of the succession in the boardroom as well as the dugout. The Glazers had known since the previous February that both Gill and Ferguson would be moving on.</p><p>And yet arguably the most important summer in the club's recent history was left in the hands of two men with no knowledge of the top end of the European transfer market, culminating in the tragi-comic deadline day pursuit of Ander Herrera, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/sep/04/manchester-united-ander-herrera-transfer-farce\" title=\"\">fake representatives and all</a>. The subsequent <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jan/25/juan-mata-completes-move-manchester-united\" title=\"\">January capture of Juan Mata </a>was hailed as a coup but gave off more than a whiff of panic.</p><p>Moyes' decision to dispense with Ferguson's backroom staff and bring in his own men meant in one summer much of the collective wisdom of the Ferguson era either walked out of the door or was left to sit impassively in the stands as things unravelled around them.</p><p>Whereas Moyes was the master of all he surveyed at Everton's Finch Farm training complex and inspired loyalty from those around him, at Manchester United he appeared unable to delegate or to focus on what mattered. Meanwhile, what little authority he had ebbed away.</p><p>As flagged up in the small print of the succession of bewildering loan agreements, bond issues, refinancing and stock market flotations since they bought United in 2005, the certainty of having to one day deal with the \"succession issue\" was the main cloud hanging over the Glazers' feat of financial engineering.</p><p>And yet they badly mishandled the first big call of their controversial nine-year tenure.</p><p>The Glazers will arrive in Manchester next week to oversee a recruitment process that they know they – and Woodward – can't afford to get wrong for a second time. On his most recent conference call, Woodward was keen to emphasise the extent to which Liverpool had been able to maintain their commercial clout despite their comparative lack of success in recent years.</p><p>Yet rather than looking to Anfield for succour, the last two decades at Liverpool should act as a loud warning siren against how far and how fast a seemingly impregnable empire can fall.</p><p>And, more than anyone, Woodward will be only too aware of the potential implications for the bottom line if they don't rejoin Europe's top table within a season. In some ways, the new Financial Fair Play era makes it even more imperative to maintain their place among the elite.</p><p></p><p>Even as talks over a new $1bn kit deal drag on, with those close to the process said to be weary of United's hardline negotiating stance, their legions of sales staff will be already digesting the possible damage the last 12 months have done to the United \"brand\".</p><p>Built on romance and doing things \"the United way\" but then remorselessly sliced, diced and sold around the world, the longer-term damage to that DNA of a chaotic season that has left the Ferguson succession plan trumpeted by Woodward crumpled and discarded may yet be worse still.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/435058161|2014-05-04T13:20:47Z|d866288f649f9dea98d2814e7d232516f7e4f390 -->",

From the management musings of interim Man Utd manager Ryan Giggs, to a hilarious column on the TV dominance of MasterChef, to sorrows in Syria, as I write this editor's blog the Guardian's website offers up many perspectives.</p><p>The Weekly captures them all.</p><p>We headline this edition with some super writing by award-winning Guardian foreign correspondent <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/lukeharding\" title=\"\">Luke Harding</a> from Ukraine, where pro-Russian activists are refusing to comply with a deal reached in Switzerland last week to de-escalate the six-month-old conflict. It can't be an easy assignment, reporting on militants in tense times, and Harding brings extensive experience of the region to the fore in this fine front-page piece. Elsewhere, we look at the late-night shootout that has left the Geneva deal in shreds, and at the concerns of neighbouring states who fear for freedoms should Russia flex more of its muscle. Timothy Garton Ash rounds out the package with a column on our Comment pages arguing that Vladimir Putin has more admirers than the west thinks. (Thoughts on this can be emailed to us by <a href=\"mailto:weekly.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\">clicking here</a>.)</p><p>Inside the paper, partner publication Le Monde reports on tensions in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/23/burma-elections-tensions-suu-kyi\" title=\"\">Burma</a> as reforms begin to stall ahead of a pivotal general election next year. Our other partner paper, the Washington Post, rounds out this coverage as the US warns that attacks against <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/23/us-burma-ethnic-violence-warning\" title=\"\">Rohingya Muslims</a> must stop.</p><p>From Latin America, we meet the women in El Salvador fighting highly restrictive abortion laws, explore how 1,500 children are being raised by parents in Bolivian jails, and learn that Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff looks set to face an unlikely alliance in presidential elections later this year.</p><p>In Europe, meanwhile, our Copenhagen diary discovers the fur trade is booming thanks to China, though the bubble may be about to pop. Stretched finances feature on our business page in a consideration of the difficulties ahead in balancing the budget for a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/22/afghanistan-economy-revenue-budget-shortfall\" title=\"\">new leadership in Afghanistan</a>.</p><p>In Syria it's submit or starve, correspondent Martin Chulov finds, in a disturbing piece of reporting from that troubled country. Sticking with the region, we catch up on electoral news in Egypt as the deadline passes for nominations in upcoming elections, leaving Abdel Fatah al-Sisi one step closer to the presidency.</p><p>The deeper-read Review section is especially strong this week. Doctor and author <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/bengoldacre\" title=\"\">Ben Goldacre</a> takes on big pharma in our Review opener, which delves into clinical trials. Le Monde takes us to the base of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/21/paris-eiffel-tower-renovation-profits-higher\" title=\"\">Eiffel Tower</a> and reports on construction work that aims to take lift profits for the 125-year-old landmark.</p><p>Discovery asks why <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/apr/18/pterosaurs-evolution-giant-flying-animals\" title=\"\">modern birds just can't measure up</a> to their dinosaur cousins, and provides some concrete answers. The Books pages revel in the carnival of creatures on the Galápagos islands, and tell the tale of giant <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/gabrielgarciamarquez\" title=\"\">Gabriel García Márquez</a>, who died last week.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/series/guardian-weekly-notes-and-queries\" title=\"\">Notes &amp; Queries</a> is as zany as ever, asking this week about the meaning of life. No doubt there will be many perspectives on this question, and much to ponder.</p><p>Which takes my thinking back to the nature of news. Whether it's football (we do have a Man Utd story, by the way, edited into the paper as our deadline neared), science, books, politics or the lighter side of life, the Weekly has it. <a href=\"mailto:abby.deveney@theguardian.com\" title=\"\">Let me know what else you'd like!</a></p><p></p><p><em>Would you like to change your delivery address?

The club would like to place on record its thanks for the hard work, honesty and integrity he brought to the role.\"</p><p>Giggs will now be in charge for the last four games of the season, beginning with Norwich at home in the 5.30pm kick-off on Saturday, followed by home games against Sunderland and Hull and finishing away to Southampton.</p><p>Moyes drove into the club's Carrington training complex on Tuesday morning for a meeting with the chief executive Ed Woodward to make his departure official. Moyes's backroom staff of Steve Round, Jimmy Lumsden and Chris Woods are also likely to depart although Phil Neville may be kept on.</p><p>The move, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/21/david-moyes-sack-manchester-united\" title=\"\">revealed in The Guardian </a>on Monday, came after the former Everton manager lost the support of United's owners, the Glazer family despite having been personally selected by Ferguson and been handed a six-year contract.</p><p>United had insisted that Moyes was still their manager on Monday, but refused to deny widespread reports the Scot was to be dismissed.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-435049709'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2014/4/22/1398170033436/giggs-car-009.jpg' alt='giggs car' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Giggs arrives at United's Carrington training ground.

It needs to be clarified pretty quickly by the club and they need to break rank and do what they don't usually do, which is make a statement pretty quickly.</p><p>\"The weight and explosion of the information coming out concerns me. That club, for 20-odd years, contained and managed information. It was completely off the scale like nothing else that's happened at the club in 20 years.\"</p><p>Managers are already being linked with the job, foremost among them the Holland manager Louis van Gaal and the former United centre-half and Paris St-Germain coach Laurent Blanc.</p><p>Carlo Ancelotti, who has also been touted as a possible successor to Moyes, was non-committal ahead of Real Madrid's Champions League semi-final meeting with Bayern Munich.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-435049710'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2014/4/22/1398169631724/chosen-007.jpg' alt='chosen' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>The Chosen One banner for Moyes at the Stretford End now feels ironic.

United will end the season with their lowest points total in Premier League history, they have not qualified for the Champions League for the first time in almost two decades and their home record this season is the worst since 1978.</p><p>The Red Devils, who won the title by 11 points under Sir Alex Ferguson last year, are seventh in the Premier League with four matches left. During his tenure Moyes won 27, drew nine and lost 15 of his 51 games in charge.</p><p>Had he not made a mess of the summer transfer window, he might have been better placed. The Scot pursued Barcelona's Cesc Fábregas when the Spaniard had no intention of leaving the Spanish club. Thiago Alcântara joined Bayern Munich ahead of United, while the club made a hash of their attempts to sign Marouane Fellaini and Leighton Baines , their bid of £28m for the pair being branded \"derisory and insulting\" by Everton.</p><p>Baines stayed and United ended up buying Fellaini for £27.5m when they could have bought him for £4m less had they acted quicker.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/435017296|2014-05-04T13:20:47Z|235b7f8fb1fd8371dd6f579963c40bc0a656bd7b -->",

        "headline":"David Moyes: football reacts to sacking of Manchester United boss",
        "body":"<p>Former footballers and celebrity fans have been reacting to Manchester United's dismissal of the manager David Moyes, after news of his removal at around 8am on Tuesday prompted millions to offer their views on social media.</p><p>There was a mix of sympathy and some anger following the decision, although many claimed to have seen it coming as Moyes endured a dismal season.</p><p>The former United captain Roy Keane said the players and club hierarchy needed to take much of the blame for Moyes's failure. \"He certainly had a hard start but I'd look at the chief executive [Ed Woodward] – he didn't get the deals done,\" Keane said on ITV. </p><p>\"I think it's a shame, he should have been given more time. Some of the players should be ashamed of themselves, they really let him down.\" </p><p>Former England, Liverpool and Manchester United player <a href=\"https://twitter.com/themichaelowen\" title=\"\">Michael Owen</a>  tweeted: \"Huge news at Old Trafford but with the summer looming and a huge transfer kitty available, United had to be 100% Moyes was the right man.\"</p><p>He added: \"Evidently they didn't have the confidence in him, in which case makes the timing absolutely right. Now the big question is who's next?\"</p><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/BlackandDwight\" title=\"\">Dwight Yorke</a>, a former United striker, told Sky that Ryan Giggs would be best. \"I think for togetherness and getting the results and playing a certain way, a brand of football that is more eye-catching, the Man United way, I feel that Ryan Giggs is the right person.\"</p><p>Retired Liverpool and England defender Jamie Carragher called the decision \"inevitable\", adding: \"Was always going to be difficult but it hasn't gone well. It's been a disastrous season.\"</p><p>Former United player Paul McGrath claimed Moyes was \"out of his depth\" at Old Trafford. \"I don't think David has the same strong personality as Sir Alex [Ferguson] and it's as simple as that,\" McGrath told the Irish Independent. \"He looked like a man under strain all season.\"</p><p>Others took a more sympathetic stance to Moyes's removal after 10 months in the job.</p><p>Match of the Day frontman <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GaryLineker\" title=\"\">Gary Lineker</a> said: \"Always thought the manager's job to have at Manchester United was the one after the one after Sir Alex.\"</p><p>It is thought the final straw was the 2-0 defeat at Everton on Sunday, United's 15th loss this season and one that pushed the reigning Barclays Premier League champions down to seventh. United will now end the season with their lowest Premier League points total.</p><p>Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti told his press conference in advance of his team's Champions League semi-final against Bayern Munich on Wednesday night: \"I am sorry for David Moyes. In general this is the life of a coach. Sometimes things don't come out well and they get rid of you and that's it. I was a bit surprised because Man United is not normally like this. It might be normal in another club but at Man United after 26 years I was surprised.\"</p><p>Late on Monday, football pundit Robbie Savage tweeted: \"If Moyes is to go, some of the players at Utd need to have a look at themselves some of their performances have been a disgrace!\"</p><p>Once the news was confirmed on Tuesday morning, he added: \"I honestly feel sorry for David Moyes.\"</p><p>Sean Bones of the Manchester United Supporters' Trust pointed the finger at the club's owners and accused the club of a \"lack of class and dignity\" in the way they handled the sacking, after the news was leaked to the press before it was officially confirmed.</p><p>Bones told Sky news: \"It was a risky decision in the first place to appoint Moyes because he wasn't proven at the highest level – that decision is down to the Glazer family.\"</p><p>This was echoed by United fan and former England cricket captain Michael Vaughan who also condemned the club: \"If you are going to sack someone at least have the decency to tell them first rather than leak it. Poor from whoever it was at United.\"</p><p>Cricketer Kevin Pietersen, who was removed from the England team this year, took a more self-deprecating approach to the news, tweeting: \"Anyone got #DavidMoyes details pls? Myself &amp; @piersmorgan want to compare notes &amp; see where we all have gone wrong this year\".</p><p>Celebrity supporters of the club also joined the fray on social media.</p><p>Britain's Got Talent judge Amanda Holden said: \"Moysey did a great job for Everton – I hope this is how he is remembered.\"</p><p>Former Tottenham chairman Lord Sugar also expressed his commiserations, tweeting: \"Anyone going there the 1st year after Sir A would have struggled. He needs another season.\"</p><p>Former editor turned television host Piers Morgan, an Arsenal fan, was quick to draw comparisons between his own team and United: \"Moyes followed someone who won 10 trophies in last 9yrs. Next Arsenal manager follows someone who's won nothing in 9yrs. Big difference\".</p><p>Just before news of his sacking broke, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/piersmorgan\" title=\"\">Morgan</a> had tweeted: \"Sir Alex recommended Moyes over [José] Mourinho because he feared the latter would eclipse his memory too fast. Harsh, selfish, reality.\"</p><p>TV presenter and lifelong Manchester United fan Eamonn Holmes said: \"I'm sure David Moyes is a nice man, but he just didn't understand our team and our players didn't understand him. This is the right thing.\"</p><p>\"Not surprised David Moyes has gone,\" added singer and United fan Olly Murs. \"I would have given him the summer to rebuild but we've been awful this season #whoarewegettingnow\".</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/435053492|2014-05-04T13:20:47Z|c25ada1d265c9b76e3d08899387fb5624dbdcf25 -->",

        "body":"<p>Almost a year ago, the scene outside Old Trafford was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/may/08/manchester-united-fans-alex-ferguson\" title=\"\">very different</a>. Underneath the statue of Sir Bobby Charlton, George Best and Denis Law, grown men blinked back tears  as they explained why life would never be the same again now that Fergie had retired.</p><p>On Tuesday, the forecourt was deserted. Security guards in hi-vis jackets told journalists they were not welcome – on orders of the management. Any interviews had to be done either in the car park or down by the Bridgewater canal.</p><p>There was no weeping this time round. Just the odd hard-nosed fan passing through and saying, for the most part, that David Moyes had to go.</p><p>\"He had his chance,\" said Daniel Moran, 19, from nearby Eccles in Salford. \"We've given him almost a full season. I do feel a little bit sorry for David Moyes and the grief he's been getting, but the fans didn't like him and he had to go.\"</p><p>A United fan since birth, Moran has been used to supporting a winning team his entire life. It's been difficult adjusting to the Moyes era, he admitted. \"I've gone off football a little bit,\" he said. Because loyalty has gone out of the game? Apparently not: \"Because we're losing.\"</p><p>The Basford family from Sheffield, visiting to buy Ethan, 10, and Leon, 5, a few holiday treats from the club shop, welcomed the news. \"I think it's a good thing,\" said mum, Gemma. \"Moyes didn't have the experience before he came and it shows because now we're not in the Champions League. I don't think he showed enough enthusiasm and I don't think he got on with the players. The players ruled the team – he wasn't strong enough to stand up to them.\"</p><p>Australian tourist John Keenan, at Old Trafford for the tour, said: \"I think it's about time; he has been given a fair while and the results are just not very good at all. Giggs will do well, he's got the respect of the other players.\"</p><p>The odd fan was more sympathetic. Ben Rickhus said: \"Something had to be done but I don't think getting rid of him now is the right thing to do at all. It won't make any difference between now and the end of the season but perhaps the club has listened to the fans.\"</p><p>James MacDonald, 18, thought that only a minority of fans really wanted Moyes out – such as those who paid to fly a plane over the ground last month trailing the banner declaring Moyes \"the wrong one\". MacDonald disapproved of such stunts but conceded: \"I suppose their money didn't get wasted. They were heard.\"</p><p>But Manchester is a city of two teams and the other side was  not rejoicing either. James Goddard, a recently retired Olympic swimmer on the Team GB squad, admitted he got a certain frisson from seeing United in turmoil.</p><p>\"It's nice to see they're a club just like everyone else. Maybe their era is over?\" he said hopefully, as he stood outside his rival's ground, waiting to take part in Dame Kelly Holmes' mentoring programme.</p><p>But he bemoaned the short-termism in the modern game. \"I heard a thing on the radio the other day saying [the Manchester City manager, Manuel] Pellegrini is now the 10th longest standing manager in the Premier League, or something like that, and he's not been with us a year. Just shows how football has changed.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/435039113|2014-05-04T13:20:47Z|dca57d13d4455b222df930a437d3d924ecb21921 -->",

The course teaches you a lot but also you have interaction with the other students and the experiences that they've got. We did some stuff on sport science, we've got five or six sport scientists at Man United; one of the lads said they haven't got one and have only got 12 full-time staff. It just makes you feel how hard it is for them, the challenges that they've got that could be different from the challenges you've got.</p><p>\"The other coaching courses you go on, you would do a bit of preparation and a bit of planning, but actually speaking and communicating, you probably wouldn't do a lot of. You would do it as player but wouldn't address a team or a group. These are all skills that they are teaching us how to get better and preparing you, really, for when you do have to do it.</p><p>\"I think you've got to be natural as much as you can as a manager, find your own style, not try and be somebody else. Different people have different characteristics. Sparky [Mark Hughes] would go on the pitch and kick lumps out of everyone, you would think he would be the most outgoing person ever but he wasn't; he was quite quiet off the pitch.</p><p>\"Roy Keane – what you see is what you get on and off the pitch; he'll tell you how it is. Paul Ince similar. Steve Bruce – different again, he was someone who helped you as a young player, a great character. And he's not changed, he's still the same person.</p><p>\"I think what this course does teach you is that there is no right or wrong way, so I might have a playing philosophy but you have to be adaptable as well. Maybe you haven't got the players to play that way, which was what Carlo Ancelotti was saying [during an interview with John Peacock, the FA's head of coaching].</p><p>\"I found that really interesting, it was similar to me, growing up on 4-4-2 really. He didn't sign Roberto Baggio because he didn't fit into his philosophy at the time. So you have to be adaptable and maybe not be: 'I'm going to play like this.' You evolve really.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/435037344|2014-05-04T13:20:47Z|4e9e8b03c76d1d48f81719a143662116e0df460b -->",

Reports of Moyes's imminent departure emerged on Monday afternoon and Neville was sad that the Scot's exit proved to be an undignified one.</p><p>\"The last 15, 16 hours or however long it's been, I don't like it, it's not the way in which the club should portray itself,\" the former right-back, who won eight Premier League titles with United, told Sky Sports News.</p><p>\"But it's the modern world, it's how things seem to be dealt with now, but I'm a traditionalist and I think it could have been dealt with a whole lot better. I believe in managers being given time, I think they should be allowed to complete their work. The idea of giving people three- and four- and six-year contracts and then getting rid of them after 10 months is something that's foreign to me.</p><p>\"However, there's no disguising that the football this season has been poor, the results have been poor. As a fan I've not enjoyed watching it – I'm sure David Moyes himself hasn't enjoyed watching it. And I can't think many Manchester United fans will have enjoyed watching it either.</p><p>\"The performances have sort of got worse and worse. There was a little bit of a pick-up before Christmas when you thought there might be a bit of a run but in the last month or two the performances have sort of deteriorated really.\"</p><p>He added: \"The players have to take massive responsibility. I never once during my 17/18-year career at United turned around after a game and thought: 'You lost us that game, boss'.</p><p>\"It's always the players. Players have to take responsibility, accountability in football. Those players there are not as bad as they have been showing, I've played with a lot of those players.</p><p>\"They've got great care for United, they love the club – the ones that I know – they're desperate to do well for the club and they have completely lost confidence. These are players who were champions nine months ago and the decline has been surprising to say the least.\"</p><p>One of the players in the dressing room Neville knows best is Ryan Giggs and the Welshman will now take charge of United until the end of the season. Moyes's predecessor Sir Alex Ferguson spent nearly 27 years in charge at United and brought both Giggs and Neville into the team after initially struggling to make an impact at Old Trafford.</p><p>Neville played with Giggs throughout his entire career at United under the Scot and the England coach believes his former team-mate is entering the lion's den, with management now being a largely thankless task.</p><p>\"It's a different world to the one it was in the 1980s when (Dave) Sexton, (Ron) Atkinson and Sir Alex Ferguson were given time through their difficult moments,\" he said.</p><p>\"That's just not going to happen any more. It's something that I don't like about the modern game, the fact that managers get sacked every 12 months. It doesn't matter whether it's my club, it's United, or any other club.</p><p>\"I genuinely believe there is a lack of decency now in the way in which football managers get dealt with at all the different clubs. They're just so much in the firing line and they accept it's a pressurised job, they get well paid for it, but I think there is a way of decency with dealing with people.</p><p>\"Football managers now just get tossed around, chucked about, disregarded, rubbished. Decent men, good men just get thrown away, and that's not just David Moyes, that's all the way through football.\"</p><p>Dwight Yorke also played in the treble-winning team of 1999 and the former striker believes Giggs could be just the man to take the job permanently.</p><p>\"I know there's a lot of people speculating that they need somebody with big experience out there that has managed a club at the very top level but we are talking about a continuity, something like what Sir Alex Ferguson did,\" he said.</p><p>\"There is never going to be someone like Sir Alex Ferguson but what we're given here is a young manager who is looking to break in. He's not got the managerial skills but we thought that David Moyes had those skills of going into Manchester United with the experience that he had for 11 years being at Everton and the wonderful job that he'd done but he hasn't been able to turn things over at Manchester United.</p><p>\"I think for togetherness and getting the results and playing a certain way, a brand of football that is more eye-catching, the Man United way, I feel that Ryan Giggs is the right person.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/435036855|2014-05-04T13:20:47Z|5f2529b01646a8298828a23224cc45a8300320e6 -->",

An announcement from the club is expected later today, it is understood.</p><p>United will also try to move quickly to install a permanent replacement for Moyes. It is understood that Holland boss Louis van Gaal is the favourite to take over, but another potential candidate in Borussia Dortmund manager Jürgen Klopp looks to be out of the picture.</p><p>Van Gaal is reportedly among the front runners. The former Barcelona manager has an impressive CV and will be available this summer when he leaves his post as Holland coach. Borussia Dortmund coach Klopp is among the fans' favourites to take over, but the club are understood to favour other candidates.</p><p>Diego Simeone is another highly regarded figure in European football after taking Atlético Madrid to the top of the Spanish league and into the semi-finals of the Champions League.</p><p>However, many fans would like to see Giggs take the post on a long-term basis, despite his lack of managerial experience.</p><p>Moyes slipped into United's base in Carrington unnoticed on Tuesday morning. Succeeding Sir Alex Ferguson, who won 13 league titles during his time at the club, was always going to be difficult, but few expected this season to have gone so badly.</p><p>The list of unwanted records broken by Moyes is as embarrassing as it is long. United are guaranteed to end the season with their worst points total in Premier League history, they have failed to qualify for the Champions League for the first time in almost two decades while Moyes' home record is the worst of any United boss since 1978 when Dave Sexton was in charge.</p><p>United are seventh in the Premier League with four matches to go, with Europa League qualification now also looking unlikely.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/435025394|2014-05-04T13:20:47Z|6b1ac8609902b78d8dab5127a949b8b0a1c99a0a -->",

        "headline":"David Moyes: Ferguson's chosen one has missed every realistic target at Man Utd",
        "body":"<p>In Frank O'Farrell's day, he started getting suspicious when he turned up for Bobby Charlton's testimonial dinner and discovered that he was not even seated on the top table for a function he had organised himself. It was the next day O'Farrell was summoned to Manchester United's boardroom to be sacked and \"A Nice Day for an Execution\", the relevant chapter of his autobiography, remembers how Matt Busby avoided eye contact as the chairman, Louis Edwards, broke the news. \"It wasn't so much I got the sack but the way they behaved as people,\" O'Farrell wrote. \"I can never forgive them for that – they were nasty beggars.\"</p><p>Wilf McGuinness ended up taking solace in a bottle of sherry when it was his turn. \"It was as if the world had ended,\" he recalled many years later. \"I was demoralised, heartbroken, horribly hurt. I'm not ashamed to admit that, in those darkest moments of my career, I literally banged my head against the wall, several times.\" Jack Crompton, the trainer, eventually found him, in a crumpled heap on the boardroom floor.</p><p>The break is rarely clean and for David Moyes nobody should make the mistake of thinking the payoff will prevent it being the most harrowing moment of his professional life. Moyes was the wrong man for the job; he just did not realise it. He will find future work, maybe even success, but his reputation will never fully recover. He will always be remembered as the man who took over from Ferguson and blew it. The modern-day McGuinness-O'Farrell, replacing a legend and, ultimately, falling so far short he will have to carry the consequences like a rucksack of bricks.</p><p>Plainly, it has been a difficult decision for United when it means abandoning everything they have always preached and going against Sir Alex Ferguson, the man who handpicked Moyes for the job and decreed that his successor, and friend, should get a six-year contract. The mind goes back to the opening night of Ferguson's book tour, on an October evening at the Lowry theatre, and what he told his audience about the management profession. \"It's a terrible industry. When clubs sack a manager there is no evidence it works. But there is evidence, and it's hard evidence, that sticking with your manager does work. This is an important issue and it is something I believe in, very strongly. Sacking a manager does not help.\"</p><p>But what if the manager is simply not up to it? Firing Moyes would not be an impetuous or shocking decision, and Ferguson will just have to live with that. Even taking into account United's determination to go by their own rules, and their distaste for football's sacking culture, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/jan/06/david-moyes-manchester-united-manager-jose-mourinho\" title=\"\">it has become abundantly clear Moyes is out of his comfort zone</a>, drowning under the weight of his work. \"The Chosen One\" the banner read. But Moyes was not the right choice and that is the awkward truth for Ferguson. It was a serious lapse of judgment that might have put United back years.</p><p>The slump – for that is what it is – has been too extreme for a club of United's ambitions to allow it to go too much further and Moyes can hardly complain when, at any of their major rivals, he would never have reached Easter. Or maybe even Christmas. \"David Moyes, in Italy, would have been sacked three times by now,\" Gianluca Vialli said in February. And since then, United's season has unravelled even more spectacularly.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/20/everton-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">That plodding defeat to Everton on Sunday</a> means Moyes' team have lost, home and away, against both Merseyside clubs for the first time in the club's history and are guaranteed their least accomplished points total of the Premier League era. Manchester City have thrashed them twice. Newcastle have won at Old Trafford for the first time since 1972, and Swansea for the first time in their history. Stoke had not beaten United since 1984 until this season and West Bromwich had not won at Old Trafford since 1978. It has started to seem like a deception that this club won their 20th league title by 11 points last season. The Moyes era, to put it bluntly, has been awful beyond anyone's expectations. Even before we get to the fact there is a banner at Anfield these days saying \"Back on our perch\", with everything that means for the club looking up from seventh position, 23 points behind, with their shoelaces tied together.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/apr/20/liverpool-norwich-brendan-rodgers-tactics\" title=\"\">Brendan Rodgers is one of the managers whose tactical expertise</a> has made Moyes look stodgy and better suited for a club with lesser ambitions. Roberto Martínez, who replaced Moyes at Everton, is another. When Moyes said United had produced outstanding football at Goodison, the perplexing thing is that he actually sounded like he meant it. When they were losing 2-0 and conspicuously short of ideas, his assistant, Steve Round, produced a ring binder entitled \"set-pieces\" and it was tempting to wonder whether they understood this club, with its history of spontaneous brilliance, and the first requirement of genuinely exciting football.</p><p>A lot of the analysis will inevitably feature on the way Moyes has \"lost\" the dressing room. The truth is actually that he had never had the dressing room. Not properly anyway. Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic, important players at Old Trafford, could never be won over. Ryan Giggs, who understands the place as well as anyone, has been thinking about not just retiring but also quitting his coaching role and walking away from the club altogether.</p><p>When senior players rebel, younger ones follow. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/20/danny-welbeck-unhappy-future-manchester-united-moyes\" title=\"\">Danny Welbeck, the only other Mancunian in the squad, has just let it be known that he wants a move</a>. Even that, in isolation, seems typical of the new United, with the story leaked on the morning Moyes faced his former club – just another demonstration of his lack of control and authority.</p><p>Just before the news broke that United intend to fire him, a supporters' poll on the Red Issue website had only 6% wanting him to survive the summer. The crowd might not have universally approved of the plane that flew a \"Moyes Out\" banner over Old Trafford recently – <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/29/manchester-united-david-moyes-out-banner-aston-villa\" title=\"\">indeed, many jeered it</a> – but that was more an issue about how they should go about making their discontent known. Moyes should just be glad it has never manifested itself in a full-on mutiny when that, feasibly, would have hurried up this whole process.</p><p>As it is, there are no apologies to be made for reiterating that United made a poor call deciding that a manager with no trophies or Champions League experience was superior to one who had won seven league titles in four countries, the European Cup with two clubs, the Uefa Cup, the FA Cup, two League Cups, the Spanish Cup and the Italian Cup, among other things.</p><p>José Mourinho, an authentic trophy machine, once went nine years without losing a home game and also has 20-odd recognised manager-of-the-year awards to his name. Yes, he can be an incredibly self-centred twerp at times, as we saw at the weekend. But so could Ferguson, frequently, and everyone in football knew Mourinho wanted the job. The counterargument is that he does not usually last beyond a certain time-frame whereas United wanted a long-term appointment. So let's say, hypothetically, he had stayed four years. They would have been a brilliant, trophy-laden four years.</p><p>Instead, Moyes will be informed that he has missed every realistic target that had been expected of him. No other manager has taken a team from first to seventh since Ray Harford at Blackburn Rovers in 1996 and it will be 17 months, minimum, before United are a Champions League club again. The bottom line is that a club this size has too much at stake to tolerate that kind of under-achievement, whether Ferguson agrees or not.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/434989832|2014-05-04T13:20:47Z|4dcc2ad0525082b049a31b2ada3986c74ae81bc0 -->",

That policy is now in ruins, with deliberations already beginning over who should succeed Moyes.</p><p>Moyes has paid the price for failings at most levels of his role as manager. Beyond a dismal title defence that has taken United from champions by 11 points to a side struggling to qualify for European football next season, are a series of off-field issues.</p><p>The prime one is how the 50-year-old has alienated many of the squad he inherited from Ferguson. As the Guardian <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jan/08/manchester-united-players-manager-david-moyes-credentials-champions-league\" title=\"\">reported in January</a> Moyes has struggled to convince some senior players of his abilities and there have been numerous disagreements with others.</p><p>Over the past few days friction between him and Danny Welbeck came to a head with the striker unhappy enough to <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/20/danny-welbeck-unhappy-future-manchester-united-moyes\" title=\"\">consider his future</a> despite being a United supporter. This followed a disagreement between the pair in December. Earlier in the season Moyes claimed he had instructed Welbeck to stay behind for extra <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/dec/17/danny-welbeck-training-david-moyes-manchester-united\" title=\"\">training</a>, telling him to follow Wayne Rooney's example.</p><p>Yet Welbeck subsequently questioned Moyes' claim, saying: \"I have been doing that ever since I have been at United. I have been injured this season so maybe the manager has not seen me on the training pitch as much.\"</p><p>Last week <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/15/manchester-united-fine-tom-cleverley-danny-welbeck-ashley-young-champions-leagus\" title=\"\">Moyes disciplined Welbeck, along with Tom Cleverley and Ashley Young</a> for a night out in Manchester following the Champions League defeat at Bayern Munich. While United had no game for 10 days before the trip to Everton – and the manager had given his squad three days off – the trio are thought to have contravened a stipulation that  they should not be out late within 48 hours of  a game.</p><p>Further evidence that Moyes has struggled for control over his players came in two episodes of indiscipline from Chris Smalling. Last month <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/david-moyes\" title=\"\">Moyes</a> acted after the defender was photographed out in the early hours of Sunday in Manchester. This followed a transgression in January when he was forced to apologise for appearing to dress as a suicide bomber at a private <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jan/09/manchester-united-chris-smalling-suicide-bomber\" title=\"\">party</a>.</p><p>Moyes has also proved insular, even with those in his inner circle, with his coaching team not always sure what his thoughts are, and he can often be a distant figure to those who work at the club's Carrington training complex. Speaking to MUTV in the aftermath of the loss at Everton, Moyes said: \"We need to end the season on a high. We want to finish by winning all of our games. We'll do everything we possibly can to make that happen.\"</p><p>Yet senior players voiced their dissatisfaction with the season. Rio Ferdinand, who was not in the squad at Goodison Park, tweeted: \"Frustration &amp; disappointment sums up the season so far.\"</p><p>On his blog, Juan Mata wrote: \"I feel very disappointed today. This is how you feel when you spend two weeks waiting for a game, getting ready for it, and then things don't go the way you wanted. It happened in Goodison Park and the truth is this is not the first time, as you know. I hate this feeling.\"</p><p>With United in seventh place, 13 points from a Champions League berth, the hierarchy seem to have had enough.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/434971687|2014-05-04T13:20:47Z|cb49469d7a91f63906d0936b53aed00dad666cd6 -->",

Away from home they have a terrific record. It was important we were focused and clear. We controlled the aspects of the game that we wanted to do.&quot;</p><p>On the low possession stats: &quot;Sometimes you need to adapt to what you're going to face on the pitch, and we are capable of adapting. With the technical players they had, it was a game we had to be very solid, very well-organised, and use the dynamic football that we have.</p><p>On Moyes: &quot;I think a lot has been said about that. I think the standing ovation he got against West Ham in the last game of last season showed it. Now there's a big rivalry, fighting for the same aims, so you're going to expect a competitive atmosphere. But everyone knows the job he did at Everton and clearly I have a lot to thank him for.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>So he's being nice to United, at least, while everyone else sticks the boot in.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-53540059e4b056a9012cdcbc\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-04-20T18:14:18.655+01:00\">6.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>OK.

Rooney has been woeful - he's offering no movement for us to attack, and is constantly dropping back and getting in the way of the nice Mata-Kagawa-Nani interplay that sometimes happens. In central midfield we've been fine in possession, but Everton's pace and technique on the counter makes Fletcher and Carrick an irrelevance when we need to defend, so our defence is completely exposed. </p><p>&quot;This lineup and style of play would be a different proposition with a quality central midfielder and either Welbeck or Hernandez instead of Rooney. One thing that's really getting on my nerves is that United fans on some forums are complaining that Kagawa hasn't been doing enough today. For months the same fans have been crying out for some short passing possession football, but the moment any of our players aim to keep possession for more than a few seconds they start saying they've not been incisive enough.

Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur are interested in signing Welbeck in the close season. The player is aware of the clubs' interest and is weighing up his options as he is intent on ensuring his career does not stall .</p><p>Moyes refused to deny speculation that Welbeck is considering his options. Asked about the striker's intention to leave, the United manager said: \"Danny Welbeck is really important to me and I really value him. There have been lots of stories. I can only tell you Danny Welbeck is really important to me and really important to Manchester United.\"</p><p>Welbeck will have two years left on his  contract in the summer, the usual juncture when fresh terms would be offered. Yet the 23-year-old, who earns around £70,000 a-week, may decide against signing  a new deal.</p><p>Earlier in the season Moyes claimed he had instructed Welbeck to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/dec/17/danny-welbeck-training-david-moyes-manchester-united\" title=\"\">stay behind for extra training</a>, informing him to follow Wayne Rooney's example. He said: \"I've got to say we had a word with him about a month ago and we said that he needs to be the last off the training field. Wayne's out there practising his finishing each day, whether it's taking free-kicks, shooting from tight angles or bending them in, whatever it may be Wayne's practising.\"</p><p>Yet Welbeck questioned Moyes' claim, saying: \"I have been doing that ever since I have been at United. I have been injured this season so maybe the manager has not seen me on the training pitch as much.\"</p><video data-media-id=\"gu-video-434959478\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">\n        <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/04/21/140421ManU-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/04/21/140421ManU_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/04/21/140421ManU/140421ManU.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/04/21//140421ManU.webm\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/04/21/140421ManU_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source>\n      </video><p>Last week Moyes disciplined Welbeck, along with Tom Cleverley and Ashley Young, for a night out in Manchester following the Champions League exit to Bayern Munich. While United had no game for 10 days before Sunday's  trip to Everton and the manager had given his squad three days off, the trio are thought to have contravened stipulations that they should not be out late within 48 hours of the tie.</p><p>If Welbeck was to leave it would be a significant blow. He is a lifelong United fan, who is from the city, and his unhappiness signals further disgruntlement within the squad. In January <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jan/08/manchester-united-players-manager-david-moyes-credentials-champions-league\" title=\"\">the Guardian reported that some senior players</a> were uncertain of Moyes' credentials and with United in seventh and 10 points from a Champions League berth the questions remain.</p><p>Nemanja Vidic, the captain, has already announced he will depart in the summer and the futures of Rio Ferdinand and Patrice Evra are also in the balance. Javier Hernández, Shinji Kagawa, Darren Fletcher, Nani, Young, Cleverley, Alexander Büttner and Ryan Giggs are other members of Moyes's squad whose futures are likewise in doubt.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/434913220|2014-05-04T13:20:47Z|8cb995ad32288db12111baff43409a17bab02490 -->",

        "headline":"Players get it right by having Luis Suárez on the PFA award shortlist",
        "body":"<p>Presenting player of the year awards before the season has reached its most important stage is a lot like tipping a taxi driver before he has finished explaining how to right society's wrongs, but that's how it is and there's nothing we can do about it here. All we can do now is discuss whether the players have picked the right people on the shortlist for the Professional Footballers' Association's award. The answer is yes. Well, Luis Suárez is on the list and that's the main thing.</p><p>There was a fear that Suárez would be shunned by his peers on the grounds <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2013/apr/22/luis-surez-bites-branislav-ivanovic-video\" title=\"\">that he can be a frightful coot</a>. His diving and ill-judged outbursts certainly grate but judge him solely on his footballing performances and the Uruguayan is a natural wonder on a par with a clicking porpoises and gnashing tigers. Suárez can take your breath away.</p><p>The statistics are eloquent even if they tell only half the story: 29 goals in 29 Premier League matches is an excellent return and the perfect reaction to being banned at the start of the season and spending much of the summer agitating for a move away from Anfield. Liverpool showed him love and shackles and he has responded by leading their sensational charge for the title. He scores all types of goals, from the mundane to the almost supernatural, and he creates chances for his team-mates and havoc in opposing defences with a unique blend of finesse and chaos. Sometimes his moaning must irritate his team-mates but most of the time his ferocious competitiveness – the very personification of <a href=\"http://www.thefootballramble.com/blog/entry/sa-blog-uruguay-la-garra-charrua-and-the-modern-game\" title=\"\"><em>la garra charrúa</em></a> – inspires them.</p><p>Suárez has not got Liverpool to the brink of the title by himself. Indeed, against the toughest opponents he has tended not to score, even though he has played well. When Suárez has not scored, Daniel Sturridge has often stepped in. Brendan Rodgers describes the duo as two soloists playing together rather than a partnership, and a part of the manager's success this season has been to devise a system in which both players can express their distinctive skills. Sturridge has improved hugely, the three decisive goals he scored in Liverpool's first three matches of the campaign giving an early indication that he had added greater reliability to his ineffable creativity. He has become England's best striker.</p><p>Steven Gerrard is not included as some Ryan Giggs-style lifetime achievement award. He is there on merit. In the twilight of his career he has adapted his role to become even more influential. Given his barnstorming past, it was by no means certain that he possessed the patience and thoughtfulness to orchestrate Liverpool's play from the base of midfield but he has risen to the task with elan and, what's more, his quietly seething focus has been key to keeping Liverpool on track for the title as the tension has mounted in the last month.</p><p>Only two other players in the league have the same big-bang creativity as Suárez, the capacity to create something amazing out of nothing. They are Sergio Agüero, whose claim for the PFA award was sabotaged by injury, and Eden Hazard. The Belgian has often been brilliant for Chelsea but, despite progress under the demands of José Mourinho, he still has a tendency to drift out of games. With more consistency he could become a great. Adam Lallana cannot be accused of lacking consistency: he has shone continually throughout the season for Southampton and, despite the flourishes of David Silva, been the best player in his position in the league. Who knows whether he has changed since he was capped by England? What is for sure is that he can change England.</p><p>It is a pity that Yohan Cabaye left the party halfway through, and not just for Newcastle United, but the player most conspicuous by his absence from the shortlist is the person who has been the best centre-back in the league this season. Maybe that reflects an understandable bias towards creative players. Or perhaps factors besides playing ability did come into the reckoning, after all. Unlucky, John Terry.</p><p>Other defenders whose excellence might have been recognised were Seamus Coleman, Sylvain Distin, Laurent Koscielny and César Azpilicueta, whose excellence has been demonstrated by the total lack of fuss about the phasing out of Ashley Cole. Meanwhile, amid a wretched season for Manchester United, David de Gea could claim to have been the best goalkeeper, though Cardiff City's David Marshall has also impressed.</p><p>Aaron Ramsey would likely have been in the running for the overall award if he had not been hobbled by injury but his superb performances in the first half of the campaign have not been forgotten and he is a contender for the PFA's young player of the year award, for which Hazard and Sturridge are also competing.</p><p>As is Raheem Sterling, another Liverpool player who has improved and redefined himself as the season progressed, having matured into so much more than a devastating winger. Luke Shaw plays with wisdom and solidity beyond his years, his toughness, composure and precision suggesting he is set for a long career at the top. As is Ross Barkley, though he has been used more sparingly by his manager this season. And if Phil Jagielka had been injured earlier in the campaign, John Stones would surely have made the list.</p><p></p><h2>PFA players' player of the year shortlist</h2><p>Steven Gerrard, Eden Hazard, Adam Lallana, Daniel Sturridge, Luis Suárez, Yaya Touré</p><p></p><h2>PFA young player of the year shortlist</h2><p>Ross Barkley, Eden Hazard, Aaron Ramsey, Luke Shaw, Raheem Sterling, Daniel Sturridge</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/434828391|2014-05-04T13:20:47Z|9ea78bd3e888e1756918c2242405e7cf3cdf3246 -->",

Crisis loomed but the Argentinian looked at his inquisitors and insisted: &quot;It's March.&quot; Then came the plea. &quot;Wait for us to be dying before you kill us off! We're still alive. Don't kill us yet!&quot;</p><p>How about now, Javier? It's April now. On Wednesday Barcelona face <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid\">Real Madrid</a> in the final of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/copa-del-rey\">Copa del Rey</a>. There is excitement but above all there is fear; a sense that, teetering on the edge, here come their biggest rivals, ready to give them the final gentle, gleeful push into the abyss below. Three, two, one ... none? Could Barcelona lose a potential treble in record time?</p><p>Back then Mascherano said that league, Champions League and Copa del Rey were all on. Momentarily, he appeared to be right: Barcelona beat City and went to the Santiago Bernab&eacute;u where they beat Real Madrid 4-3. Three days later, Madrid were defeated at Sevilla; Barcelona had the title in their own hands. Maybe he had been right when he said: &quot;In pre-season you dream of being in a situation like this. It's time to step on the accelerator.&quot;</p><p>Instead, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/09/atletico-madrid-barcelona-champions-league-match-report\">Barcelona have been a car crash. It is six days since they were beaten by Atl&eacute;tico Madrid in the Champions League</a>, the first time they have not reached the semi-final in seven years. The criticism was intense and their coach, Gerardo Martino, did himself few favours, particularly when he made the baffling admission &quot;we were not interested in Messi being involved that often&quot;, but there was much to fight for. Three days later the headline on the front of the pro-Barcelona newspaper Sport declared: &quot;We'll die for the double.&quot; The other Barcelona-based sports daily El Mundo Deportivo added: &quot;Two to go.&quot;</p><p>Make that one. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/12/granada-barcelona-la-liga-match-report\">Barcelona lost 1-0 at Granada, a team fighting relegation</a>. This time the headline pointed the finger at Martino and at the impending crisis. &quot;Tataclysm,&quot; it said.</p><p>When the players returned to the Camp Nou from Granada, there were a handful of fans waiting. Some shouted abuse. Messi was criticised too; the man who has often disguised the crumbling edifice, whose performances could be undermined by the continued failure to sign an actual defender, stands accused of reserving himself for the World Cup. Knives were being sharpened across Catalonia.</p><p>Defeat left Bar&ccedil;a third, a point behind Real Madrid and four behind Atl&eacute;tico with five games left. Their chances of winning the league appear to have vanished.</p><p>And, now, make that none? Three days later they face Real Madrid in the cup final. Less an opportunity, more an obligation.</p><p>The optimists reason that they are the side who have faced Real Madrid twice this season and beaten them both times, including that stunning win at the Bernab&eacute;u. The optimists note that Leo Messi, the focus of much of the criticism, has scored 21 times against Real Madrid in 27 games, more goals than against anyone else. They will note, too, that Cristiano Ronaldo, who scored the winner last time they met in the final at Mestalla in 2011, will miss the game through injury but the optimists are outnumbered.</p><p>V&iacute;ctor Vald&eacute;s is injured and there may be no natural centre-backs available. Carles Puyol, Gerard Piqu&eacute; and Marc Bartra all travelled with the squad but none have been given the all clear by doctors. Mascherano's performances have dipped markedly.</p><p>And the problems go far deeper than that. All year there have been doubts, played out against a backdrop of institutional collapse; there has been bad luck but the planning has been appalling and the price being paid is a high one.</p><p>As Andr&eacute;s Iniesta put it, win or lose: &quot;If there have to be changes there have to be changes.&quot; Two of the three captains, Puyol and Vald&eacute;s, have already announced their departure but other movement – and there was to be lots of it – is on hold, pending the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/02/barcelona-transfer-ban-fifa-fine\">transfer ban imposed by Fifa for breaking rules on signing international players under 18.</a> It is already overdue.</p><p>All season Barcelona have been just a couple of defeats from a crisis. This is not just a snap reaction to two sudden, shock defeats and the worst thing about those losses is that they were coming.</p><p>Against Atl&eacute;tico, only the two goalkeepers ran less than Messi and only just: Jos&eacute; Pinto ran 1.5km fewer. In five games against Atl&eacute;tico, Barcelona have won none. They have scored just twice. They have now gone two matches in a row without scoring and if that does not sound too bad, look a little deeper: they have scored only five goals in their last five games, against Granada, Betis, Espanyol and in the two games against Atl&eacute;tico. Three came from penalties (one on the rebound) and another was an own goal.</p><p>Some see redemption in the cup but success at the Mestalla may bring mixed emotions. Charly Rexach played for Barcelona between 1965 and 1981 and talks about winning the cup, &quot;their cup&quot;, as a way of &quot;really pissing [Real Madrid] off.&quot; It was also a way of salvaging a season at a time when Barcelona knew they were inferior: the league title in 1974 was their first in 14 years and they had to wait a further 11 to win it again under Terry Venables.</p><p>This is nowhere near as dramatic, of course, but there is a desire not to return to that identity. This century, Barcelona are Spain's most successful club, not Real Madrid. Victory in the Copa del Rey will be celebrated but a cup success, even against their greatest rivals, will not make this a good season and will not alter the need for repairs. It will help, though.</p> </div> </div><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/434675870|2014-05-04T13:20:47Z|8b0e34bd6a2676d8f30a3953275f6a94997d064c -->",

        "body":"<p>Bobby Moore never got a bathmat wet in his life. Mike Summerbee, who sometimes shared a room with Moore on England trips, said he was \"the only man who could have a bath and get out dry\". Moore would flick the water off one leg, dry that with a towel and then step out on to the dry leg, before continuing the process with the rest of his body. Moore's routine will come as no surprise to those who watched his immaculate, pristine defending. Nor will the fact that he brought such meticulousness to his wardrobe, where jumpers were hung up in order from dark to light. \"It was,\" says his first wife Tina in Bobby Moore: By The Person Who Knew Him Best, \"almost an aesthetic pleasure to open the wardrobe.\"</p><p>The fastidiousness demonstrated by Moore is one of the sub-genres of perfectionism within football. There's also the impossible, self-torturing expectations of perfectionist-winners such as Soren Lerby and Roy Keane, whose business face should be the subject of a modernist painting entitled simply: 'Standards'. Other significant manifestations include the perfection-making practice of forces of nurture like Peter Shilton or Cristiano Ronaldo, Spain's obsessive-compulsive tiki-taka and Pep Guardiola's need for control, and the artistic leanings of players like Eric Cantona and Dimitar Berbatov.</p><p>If you put all those types of perfectionism on a Venn diagram, the man in the middle might be Dennis Bergkamp, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/sep/21/dennis-bergkamp-arsenal-love-game\" title=\"\">the perfectionist's perfectionist</a>. Thierry Henry said he loved \"Every. Single. Thing\" about Bergkamp, but the thing he loved the most was the way Bergkamp trained, because \"everything had to be perfect\". Bergkamp also had unrealistic expectations – of himself, if not necessarily others - and was a sucker for cleanliness. The Guardian's <a href=\"https://twitter.com/amylawrence71/status/381674080618835968\" title=\"\">Amy Lawrence noticed how starched his socks were during an interview 10 years ago</a>, a revelation that would not surprise Patrick Vieira. \"To make his kind of passes you have to like things to be perfect,\" says Vieira in Stillness and Speed. \"I wouldn't be surprised if his clothes are really well organised. I wouldn't be surprised at all.\" Finally there is perfection as aesthetic idealism, the thing with which Bergkamp is most associated and which informed so much of what he did on a football field.</p><p>Bergkamp's imagination was his gift and his curse. It elevated him above his peers, but it is also meant he was in danger of driving himself round the bend aiming for something that he could not explain and which might not even exist; he was almost striving for Godot. The life of a perfectionist is not easy. Or so we'd imagine. Most people are casual perfectionists at best, and confuse perfectionism with self-loathing, yet it's comforting to indulge that vague notion because the reality – that adulthood is what happens while you're busy making compromises on your youthful ideals – is too dispiriting to acknowledge. Yet every now and then you come across someone for whom perfectionism is a way of life, who has no choice but to embrace an existence in which anything less than the best is a felony.</p><p>Perfection is a recurring theme of Stillness and Speed, Bergkamp's excellent book. One chapter is called 'It Has To Be Perfect', which is both his mantra and an indication that his co-author David Winner wasn't a Fairground Attraction fan. \"Well, you set yourself goals, targets,\" he says in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/sep/21/dennis-bergkamp-arsenal-love-game\" title=\"\">this extract from the book</a>. \"And once you've got there you want to move on and go further. You keep raising the bar and therefore it's never good enough. You want perfection. It's never good enough but it's within your reach. You climb one mountain and see the higher one.\"</p><p>On 4 July 1998, Bergkamp climbed the highest mountain for 2.11 seconds – the time it took for him to produce the three divine touches and score the penultimate-minute winner against Argentina that put Holland into the World Cup semi-final. \"Perfect\" was Ruud Gullit's description on ITV that night. \"You never play the perfect game,\" said Bergkamp later, \"but the moment itself was, I think, perfect.\" Both stalled over the P-word, as if they would be sent straight to hell for sacrilege should they misuse it, before realising that, actually, yes, that was the only way to describe it. Given Dutch football's obsession with creative purity, you know something special has happened when a Dutch footballer describes something as perfect.</p><p>In One Moment In Time, her rhapsodic treatment of spiritual fulfilment, Whitney Houston beseeched: \"Give me one moment in time, when I'm more than I thought I could be.\" For Bergkamp, this was it. \"You're in that moment,\" said Bergkamp. \"That's the feeling. After the first two touches … that <em>moment!</em> You give absolutely everything. It's like your life has led up to this moment.\"</p><h2>The reprieve</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-434561482'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2014/4/15/1397520955436/Dennis-Bergkamp-009.jpg' alt='Dennis Bergkamp' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Holland fans celebrate with a cut-out figure of Bergkamp. Photograph: Popperfoto/Popperfoto/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>One man never gets the thanks he deserves for his part in Bergkamp's goal. Not Frank de Boer – whose creation of the goal is regularly acknowledged – but José María García-Aranda. He was the Spanish referee who inexplicably declined to send Bergkamp off for stamping on Sinisa Mihajlovic during Holland's 2-1 win over Yugoslavia in the second round five days earlier. Bergkamp misplaced the plot, as was his occasional wont, and should have walked. \"I haven't the faintest idea why I did that,\" he says. \"I was startled by my own behaviour.\"</p><p>He was not alone in that. On the morning of the game, most papers focused not on the prospect of an immense quarter-final but on Arsène Wenger's criticism of Bergkamp, who had been the Player of the Year in Arsenal's domestic double that season. It may have been on Bergkamp's mind, because he was quiet for large parts of the game. Indeed apart from producing one of the World Cup's greatest goals and one of the most imaginative assists, he did the square root of bugger all.</p><p>Bergkamp argues that he did <em>two</em> great things that day, and he'll be thrilled to know that we agree with him. The first came in the 12th minute, an ingenious falling header to create the opening goal for Patrick Kluivert. The more you watch it, the better it gets. Bergkamp almost invents a new type of pass, the square through ball. He was always as much an architect and geometrician as he was a footballer – as a child he was obsessed with geometry – and was forever highlighting that a football pitch was so much bigger than it seemed as 20 men were magnetised towards the ball. Bergkamp could find acres of space and strip a defence naked with one pass, as shown in Jeroen Henneman's diagram (\"One moment the pitch is crowded and narrow. Suddenly it is huge and wide … A miracle\") in Winner's book Brilliant Orange.</p><p>In football it's often said that the run makes the pass. With Bergkamp, the pass regularly made the run – either by ushering a player like Nicolas Anelka into a certain area, or because those like Anelka and Kluivert know from experience what Bergkamp would explore. In this case, forewarned was dangerously forearmed.</p><p>Bergkamp was among that small, counter-instinctive group of players who seemed to get as much joy from an assist as from a goal. Thus in many ways this pass to Kluivert, rather than the goal, was truly representative of his career: the awareness and creation of space, the quick wit and, of course, the gentle touch. In a split-second, he worked out all the angles – in both senses – and utilised an extra-sensory perception in a way that evokes those breathless, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5s8V-RqBxEQ\" title=\"\">deductive visual analyses</a> so beloved of Benedict Cumberbatch's Sherlock Holmes every time he meets a stranger or finds a dead body.</p><p><em>Ronald de Boer's pass is flat and hard and waist high too high to control with my foot and too low for my chest so I have to fall to my left and squash my body so that I can cushion it with my head but where do I cushion it out of the corner of my eye I see Kluivert making a run off Chamot if I head it towards him between Sensini and Chamot the control will be too difficult at high speed besides there isn't much space there the space is between Sensini who has come towards me and Ayala who has gone out to meet de Boer so I need to play almost a square pass with my head the other side of Sensini into the angle of Kluivert's run I can't cushion it as gently with my head as with my foot but that's fine because the space is fairly big and if I head it too softly Roa will stay on his line and stay big so it's okay to put a fraction more on it to entice Roa from his line because if he comes out Kluivert has a much easier finish.</em></p><p>It's often said of more prosaic footballers that they are much better when they don't have time to think. Bergkamp was one of the most thoughtful footballers of all, yet the same rules applied to him. His greatest gift was his instinctive intelligence. When he had time to consider things he was often less effective – look at his penalty record for a start – and his best work was done when he had barely a split second to compute everything. When he was in that <em>moment</em>.</p><p>\"It's like solving a puzzle,\" <a href=\"http://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/dennis-bergkamp-one-one\" title=\"\">he said in FourFourTwo</a>. \"I always had a picture in my head of how things would look two or three seconds later. I could calculate it. There's a tremendous pleasure in doing something that someone else couldn't see.\"</p><p>The Dutch have always seen football through different eyes to the rest of the world. Yet for all the grandiose talk and pompous riddles of someone like Johan Cruyff, the way the Dutch play football has always been very simple and unpretentious. With the exception of that goal at Newcastle, not so much a blockbuster as a brainbuster, Bergkamp's work was always straightforward and accessible, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/jun/19/barcelona.brazil\" title=\"\">which is not always the case with great footballers</a>. Bergkamp was a reminder of the economy, minimalism and humility of most great sportsmen. He frequently played one-touch and there was scarcely any indulgence or attempt to show how clever he was. It's so much harder to make something complex look simple than the other way round. That was one of Bergkamp's greatest qualities. \"I don't like tricks,\" he says. \"My game is about first touch, control, passing. Art for art's sake isn't interesting.\"</p><p>If Bergkamp was accessible to the layman, that doesn't mean those who played alongside him didn't find an extra layer to appreciate. Bergkamp was very much a players' player, the subject of rare reverence from those he played against and particularly with. \"I honestly didn't think a professional player could be that good,\" said Paul Merson. Ian Wright said he was \"the greatest signing Arsenal will ever make\" and Henry, whose list of team-mates includes Zinedine Zidane and Lionel Messi, says Bergkamp was the greatest he played alongside. Moments like the Kluivert assist explain why he was so revered.</p><p>After Holland took the lead Bergkamp began to drift out of the game. Claudio López equalised for Argentina in the 17th minute, nutmegging Edwin van der Sar in a manner so cocky as to remind us why the one-on-one is football's greatest masculinity-waving contest. Thereafter the game flowed beautifully, and has a strong case for being the best match in a World Cup full of excellent contests. It was the kind of classy, open game you only get when two teams are formidably comfortable both in their own skin, and with the ball at their feet.</p><p>It was also a match loaded with significance, the first competitive meeting between the sides since Argentina beat Holland in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/apr/17/newsstory.sport\" title=\"\">the 1978 World Cup final</a>. That match was Bergkamp's first memory of football: he was eight years old, standing at his home at Amsterdam, watching with confused childish distress as Rob Rensenbrink hit the post in the last minute of normal time before Argentina went on to win in extra-time.</p><p>Twenty years later, Wim Jonk and Ariel Ortega rattled the post in the first half. In the second, Gabriel Batistuta staged an impromptu test of the quality of the craftsmanship of the official Fifa World Cup goalframe, walloping the post from 15 yards. The match seemed to swing Argentina's way in the 76th minute, when Arthur Numan was sent off for a second yellow card. Holland moved tactics expert Philip Cocu to left back and, although Argentina inevitably dominated possession thereafter, Holland were not unduly stretched – until the 87th minute, when a sensory overload of action changed everything.</p><p>Ortega, a strong contender for the player of the tournament at that stage, ran at Jaap Stam in the box and dived. The referee gave nothing – a brilliant decision that could easily have gone the other way, with the dive only really apparent in slow motion. As Van der Sar came to remonstrate, Ortega, bristling with the kind of righteousness that only the guilty can summon, rose from the floor to stick his head into the underside of Van der Sar's chin. What was going to be a yellow card for diving morphed into a red, and both sides had a couple of minutes to consider the changing circumstances before entering a 10-a-side golden goal period.</p><p>It didn't get that far. Fifty-three seconds after play restarted, Bergkamp produced his masterpiece. The quality of the goal is what is most spoken about now, but at the time the savageness of the swing was the most significant aspect of the overwhelming joy it created among the Dutch fans. One moment Holland had been hanging on with 10 men; the next they were 2-1 up and in the semi-final.</p><p>Bergkamp said it was like his life had been leading up to this moment. The game certainly hadn't. For much of the second half, and particularly in the buildup to the goal, Bergkamp was dreadful. This is not the playful hyperbole of which modern writers are regularly guilty but a legitimate appraisal of his performance. He looked like he'd won a competition to play in a World Cup quarter-final.</p><p>Between the red cards for Numan and Ortega, Bergkamp touched the ball only three times in 11 minutes. Once he conceded a throw-in with a tackle, twice he misplaced simple passes – the second, in a dangerous area in his own half, launched the attack in which Ortega had a penalty appeal and was sent off. Even after that, in the 53 seconds between the restart and the goal, Bergkamp had time for his worst touch of the match – he tried to play a simple short pass to Marc Overmars, kicked it against his standing foot and launched an Argentina break. When that attack broke down, Holland pottered about at the back for a few seconds before Frank de Boer spotted some movement up front …</p><p>Occasionally great goals come in the context of dismal personal performances. It's the great players' beautiful interpretation of \"winning ugly\" – demonstrating the ability to bend games not to their will but to their skill. Ryan Giggs against Arsenal in 1999 is another significant example. Perhaps playing so poorly creates a certain freedom, an \"oh-bugger-it\" attitude (as Matthew Engel, on these pages, memorably described England's cricket against South Africa during a famous victory in 1994). Or maybe, as with so much great sport, it just happened.</p><p>Frank de Boer got things going with a refresher course in the difference between a long ball and a long pass – \"a stretch-limo of a pass,\" as Cris Freddi describes it <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Complete-Book-World-Cup-ebook/dp/B00HJY13V0\" title=\"\">in his definitive World Cup history</a>. Indeed, needing only four touches as it did, this was that rarest of goals: the kind that could be appreciated equally by Johan Cruyff and Charles Hughes.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-434561483'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2014/4/15/1397520582156/Dennis-Bergkamp-009.jpg' alt='Dennis Bergkamp' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Bergkamp flicks the ball past Roa. Photograph: Georges Gobet/AFP/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>After the pass came the holiest of holy trinities, three perfect touches from Bergkamp. The first would have been a breathtaking piece of control even if that was the extent of the exercise. Bergkamp was so high in the air that it's almost a surprise his fear of flying didn't kick in. He was also running at full pelt, yet still managed to kill the ball with a telescopic leg and a right boot made of velvet and velcro. Even in that split-second, Bergkamp processed that he had to control it with his instep rather than the side of his foot. <a href=\"http://sabotagetimes.com/reportage/arsenal-legend-bergkamp-on-his-favourite-ever-goal/\" title=\"\">This interview</a> gives an insight into the staggering amount of information a human being can process in just over two seconds: Bergkamp factored in everything from the wind to the line of the ball to the defender's movement to the angle of an eventual shot and consequent need to use his right rather than his left foot. It's easy to think Bergkamp is embellishing it but we have seen this so often; Diego Maradona, for example, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2009/may/15/maradona-pele-platini-rivaldo-suker-falcao\" title=\"\">showed startling total recall</a> during a similarly career-defining goal against England in 1986.</p><p>Bergkamp is unusual in that most of his great goals – Argentina, Leicester, Newcastle, Spurs – are remembered more for the first touch than the finish. He loved making goals, and it's almost as if that was his way of supplying an assist for himself. If you wanted to go the full pseud, you could call it a pre-goal.</p><p>In this case, Bergkamp still had a serious amount to do even after the immaculate control. His game was all about the manipulation and creation of space – but usually that involved through balls into the spacious area behind defences. This time, with the sweeper Roberto Ayala roaring across full of misplaced determination, Bergkamp had a phonebox to work with at best. No matter; his second touch ushered Ayala off <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoffrey_Green#Match_of_the_Century\" title=\"\">towards the wrong fire</a>, and set him up for the shot.</p><p>\"After the second touch I know this can't go wrong,\" he says. \"No chance!\" That's one way of looking at it. The other is that with each brilliant touch, the pressure to make it count becomes greater. Look at Rivaldo here after another <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdCKI2e-Vc0\" title=\"\">long pass from Frank de Boer</a>; Barcelona score, but he looks like a man who has just realised he's accidentally put the family chihuahua in the slow cooker. His face is a picture of repressed distress because he knows he missed the chance to score one of the greatest goals in history.</p><p>Bergkamp took the chance to do so. By then he was in that zone – \"that <em>moment</em>\" – and nothing could go wrong. With the outside of his right foot, he flicked the ball past Carlos Roa and into the top corner, an appropriately elegant finish. Confirmation of the rare quality of the goal came from the BBC commentary box. \"Beautifully pulled down by Bergkamp – OH WHAT A GOAL! DENNIS BERGKAMP HAS WON IT FOR HOLLAND. That was absolutely brilliant.\" <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8lJo57gJ_c\" title=\"\">Barry Davies had not shouted as loud in the commentary for 27 years</a>, since the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxVtScYFT6c\" title=\"\">\"Leeds will go mad\" game</a>. \"The sound supervisor only just managed to keep my voice in range,\" he said later. Davies is the greatest commentator there has ever been; when he cries wolf, you know the sheep are about to get eaten. The same with Martin Tyler's commentary at the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C2dghleJxM#t=7m35s\" title=\"\">height of Serie A's most dramatic game</a>.</p><p>In Holland it was even better, with Jack Van Gelder repeatedly screaming <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azUgsIkBGYc\" title=\"\">\"DENNIS BERGKAMP!\"</a> Van Gelder was not the only one who seemed on the cusp of tears. Bergkamp's face almost dissolved. If he was startled by his own behaviour against Yugoslavia, when he stood on Mihajlovic, he was overwhelmed by it here. He thrusted his hands straight over his face in shock. Whether subconscious or coincidental, it became a charming nod to Rinus Michels's similar reaction 10 years earlier when Marco van Basten scored his <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMIFWM2yJW8\" title=\"\">staggering volley in the European Championship final against the USSR</a>. The Dutch have a football imagination like no other, yet sometimes they even shock themselves.</p><p>As Bergkamp collapsed on his back, the camera showed a sea of Holland shirts behind the goal on a gorgeously sunny day: brilliant orange in the stands, blindingly brilliant orange on the pitch. After the game, Bergkamp was coming to terms with what he had achieved. In his post-match interview, he was a picture of self-satisfaction – the good kind. He looked like the cat who first discovered cream.</p><p>Bergkamp has not watched the goal since 1998. \"It's still in your mind,\" he says. \"I don't really need to see it on television, I know exactly how it went.\"</p><h2>The consummate footballer-artist</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-434561484'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2014/4/15/1397521458999/Dennis-Bergkamp-003.jpg' alt='Dennis Bergkamp' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Bergkamp wheels away after scoring the winning goal. Photograph: Popperfoto/Popperfoto/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>Dennis Bergkamp is rarely ranked among the 10 or 20 greatest players of all time. Last year, when World Soccer asked 73 journalists, managers and former players to select their all-time XI, Bergkamp did not get a single vote. He never won the Ballon d'Or (though he did finish second in 1993). Yet he will endure, and with good reason. It will be seen as a bit pseudish, but the fact is that to many people Bergkamp is the consummate footballer-artist. We all want to align ourselves with the beautiful people, and Bergkamp was inevitably the subject of a kind of aspirational admiration, as if \"getting\" him would somehow imbue the 5.24am train commute and the rest of your life with greater romance and meaning.</p><p>For all the brilliant things that footballers do, the pass and the first touch is the really good stuff, and Bergkamp specialised in those. His best moments represent football at its most profound. Bergkamp had a supernatural capacity for creation that hinted at a tantalising level of intelligence and technique we could appreciate even if we couldn't understand it. He specialised in moments – or rather, in <em>moments</em> – and Argentina was the pick of those. It was übergkamp.</p><p>\"You play football with your head,\" says Cruyff, \"and your legs are there to help you.\" If the brain is the most erogenous zone of all, then Bergkamp might be the sexiest football of the modern era. Yet all this would be try-hard horse pucky if it didn't amount to anything. Bergkamp practised what he preached when he said that \"art for art's sake isn't interesting\". And that's why the goal against Argentina meant so much to him, more than any other.</p><p>\"Every boy has a dream: 'I want to score in the World Cup.' Score the winning goal in the final, of course. But in this way … to score a goal like that, in my style? The way I score a goal, on that stage, in a game that <em>really</em> means something, because that's important to me too. I love good football, nice football but it has to mean something.\"</p><p>It was deep and meaningful against Argentina. \"I should be more of a killer,\" Bergkamp says in Brilliant Orange, \"but it's just not a quality I have.\" He had it for those few seconds. He was creator and killer, everything he knew he could be and something he thought he couldn't. That context is why the goal is so special to us, too. It's the point at which the two schools of football – football as art and football as a results business – come together in harmony to create a unique moment, and a perfect goal.</p><p><em>With thanks to Cris Freddi, whose </em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Complete-Book-World-Cup-ebook/dp/B00HJY13V0\" title=\"\"><em>World Cup history is the best around by a mile</em></a><em>, and Daniel Harris, </em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Promised-Land-Manchester-Historic/dp/1909715050\" title=\"\"><em>whose Treble book needs reading</em></a><em>.

        "headline":"Wigan are aiming to make the Wembley experience count, says Jordi Gómez",
        "body":"<p>Wigan Athletic are becoming as synonymous with Wembley as the town's rugby team, who practically owned the venue as well as the Challenge Cup in the 80s and 90s. Back by virtue of a stunning quarter-final win at Manchester City to contest the first of this season's FA Cup semi-finals, the holders are making their fourth Wembley appearance within a year whereas their opponents have been to the new stadium only twice and lost on both occasions.</p><p>\"I think Arsenal need to win this game,\" Wigan's Jordi Gómez says with a hint of mischief in his smile. \"They are the ones under all the pressure. They are the big team, although we have won more trophies in the last 10 years than they have. We are going to be there to enjoy the day, there is no need to be panicking or whatever. It's just another game, we are not even all that excited about it. That is more for the fans than the players. We would like to win, and we can win, but we don't need to win. There is far less pressure on us.\"</p><p>One of the reasons Wigan's Spanish midfielder is so keen to enjoy his latest Wembley day out is because last year's FA Cup celebrations were so severely curtailed by relegation a matter of days later. At Arsenal. \"We had all the highs and lows of football in the space of four days,\" he explains. \"We won the final on the Saturday and played at Arsenal on the Tuesday. There was no drinking or partying on the coach back to Wigan from Wembley. We had ham sandwiches and water, that was it. But for me it was OK. Water is nice. And we had won the FA Cup.\"</p><p>Few imagined Wigan would make such a doughty defence of the trophy, especially as Roberto Martínez had moved on to Everton, yet despite a false start to the season under Owen Coyle it has been onwards and upwards since the arrival of Uwe Rösler. Not only have three Premier League sides been dispatched already in the FA Cup, but Wigan have moved back towards the top of the Championship and remain on course for a play-off place.</p><p>\"We are in a good position now,\" Gómez says. \"The new manager has improved our discipline and we are physically stronger as well. There is more organisation on the pitch, we work hard in training but the results are good, so everyone enjoys it. With our Europa League fixtures at the start of the season we have probably played more games than anyone else but there is a big squad here with a lot of quality. Anyone can come in and do a good job for the team, I feel we are growing stronger rather than becoming tired.\"</p><p>Gómez is philosophical about the change of managers, despite the fact that it was Martínez who introduced him to England and worked with him at Swansea and Wigan.</p><p>\"I owe Roberto a lot, but I didn't worry when he left,\" he says. \"It is good to work with other managers, to prove yourself all over again. All managers have different ideas about the way things should be done so you get to experience new things. The Wigan manager now is doing a great job and I enjoy working with him, but I still follow Roberto's career. It's great to see him doing so well at Everton.</p><p>\"I think he is one of the best managers around and soon he will be one of the best in world football. He could do a job like Real Madrid or Barcelona no problem, it would not surprise me at all were he to end up in charge of one of the really big teams.\"</p><p>Now 28, Gómez began with Barcelona's C and B teams before moving to Espanyol, where he had played only three first-team games when Swansea took him on a season-long loan.</p><p>He duly returned to Espanyol and would probably have stayed in Spain but for Martínez moving to Wigan, where the funds were available to secure a permanent transfer for a fee in the region of £1.7m.</p><p>It is fair to say Gómez was not an immediate success in Lancashire. It took a while for Wigan supporters to appreciate why their manager placed such confidence in him, but having made the transition and scored a few important goals  – Gómez was on the scoresheet in last season's quarter-final at Everton as well as breaking the deadlock with a penalty this year at Manchester City – he is more than happy with his career in England.</p><p>\"I played in the Barcelona youth teams with Lionel Messi and Gerard Piqué, so everyone seems to believe I must be disappointed to find myself at Wigan,\" he says. \"I don't look at it quite like that. I am happy to have a career in football. At Barcelona there are a lot of players who come through the youth team and don't make it in the game. Most of them, you could say. I'm glad to be where I am. I've played in the Premier League, I've won the FA Cup, I enjoy what I am doing.</p><p>\"It is very difficult to break into the first team at Barcelona and other teams at the very top. It is good to start out at Barcelona but it doesn't guarantee you a career in football. Even with Messi, although you could see he was very good, you never knew for certain that he would make it. You never can tell. You certainly couldn't have predicted at that stage that he would go on to become the best player in the world.\"</p><p>Gómez relaxes with yoga, both at the club and at home in Manchester, and rates peace of mind as the most important factor in bringing the best out of himself on the pitch. \"If you are disciplined in yoga you are disciplined in football, your life, everything,\" he says. \"It makes you stronger both mentally and physically, look at Ryan Giggs. People laugh about yoga, but they don't know anything about it. Peace of mind is key for life. I have it, but I want more.\"</p><p>He may well do, though Gómez seems relaxed enough. Championship players are supposed to be a little nervous about the prospect of facing a Champions League side at Wembley, but Gómez just jokes about the expense of bringing his family over from Spain – \"again!\" – and looks forward to getting out on the famous turf. \"We had the belief to beat Manchester City last month,\" he says. \"We beat them the previous season and we knew we could do it again. That's the confidence we have in the team. We go into every game thinking we can win, and of course that includes Arsenal, because we would all like to go to the final again.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/434305549|2014-05-04T13:20:47Z|d48d83ad56307bd48e067527664a4edc97326595 -->",

He has previously worked for the Guardian and the Independent and local newspapers in the north of England, where he still lives, the only Evertonian in a family of Liverpool and Wigan Athletic supporters. No awards, books or television career to speak of, but he once saw a bloke on the tube laughing out loud while reading his column. He lives in hope that in another five years or so he might spot another one. Or even the same one</p>",

        "body":"<p>The next time a football crowd chants \"Who ate all the pies?\" the answer could well be Danny Mills. The former Leeds and England defender has emerged as one of the new owners of the West Cornwall Pasty Company – purveyor of 8m tongue-scorching savoury pastries every year.</p><p>The tough-tackling right-back turned BBC pundit is part of a consortium of wealthy individuals who  bought the company out of administration, saving 274 jobs at 34 stores.</p><p>Mills, who retired as a player five years ago after a knee injury, is no stranger to the apron – he made the final of the 2012 series of Celebrity Masterchef. But his interest in the pasty business is as an investor.</p><p>Mills, who also has interests in commercial and residential property, is a partner in the private equity firm Enact, alongside a former HSBC banker, a senior partner at the accounting firm Deloitte and a retail entrepreneur who founded the Republic fashion chain.</p><p>Mills and his financial partners stepped in to rescue the ailing pasty chain when the firm was unable to pay its rent bills. Yesterday, it went into administration – and was swiftly bought by Mills's new team.</p><p>The former footballer, once red-carded for kicking a ball at an injured player, said: \"It's a fantastic name and a fantastic brand and we are saving jobs and taking the company to the next level. Pasties are a must-have item on the British menu around the UK that everybody knows and loves.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-434347944'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/4/11/1397242487897/West-Cornwall-Pasty-Compa-011.jpg' alt='West Cornwall Pasty Company ' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Customers outside a branch of the West Cornwall Pasty Company on Kings Road, Chelsea, London. Photograph: Nils Jorgensen/Rex Features</figcaption></figure><p>David Chubb, joint administrator for West Cornwall Pasty Co, said the company had run out of alternative options after facing severe difficulties in meeting its financial obligations.</p><p>He said the sale to Enact, a £7.5m private equity fund was the best outcome for the business and would ensure the company had a more secure future.</p><p>However, 31 stores will close, resulting in 92 redundancies.</p><p>Mills said the new owners were looking at expanding the group's menu, launching a new marketing campaign and possibly opening more stores.</p><p>He added that Enact had considered hundreds of investment opportunities since it launched in December and that it wanted to back small- and medium-sized businesses that were struggling to get funding from banks or had been mismanaged.</p><p>Retiring footballers used to go into the pub business, but modern footballers prefer the restaurant trade. Mills's new venture puts him in the same league as a whole team of current and former England players who have moved into the food business, from Rio Ferdinand, who owns the Manchester eaterie Rosso, to Gary Neville and Ryan Giggs, who recently opened Cafe Football in the Westfield shopping centre next to the Olympic stadium. The Wolves legend Steve Bull owns Bravaccio in Wolverhampton.</p><p>The West Cornwall Pasty Company – which despite its name is based in Buckinghamshire – was founded by the serial entrepreneur Ken Cocking, together with his two sons, in 1998. They opened their first store in Chippenham, Wiltshire, and the firm was intially backed by a number of family friends.</p><p>In 2007, the business was sold to a management buyout backed by the private equity firm Gresham for £40m and claimed to have sold its 50 millionth pasty two years later. Gresham aimed to turn the pasty company that once proudly used the slogan \"From Cornish yokels to pasty moguls\" into a fastfood chain that could challenge the burger giants.</p><p>The company still makes all its pasties in Penryn, near Falmouth in Cornwall, and has expanded from the classic pasty – originally a meal in a pastry case for Cornish tin miners – to a range of more exotic flavours including lamb and minted peas to chicken and spicy chorizo.</p><p>Mills declined to name his favourite from the menu. \"All of them are my favourite,\" he said diplomatically.</p><p>Chris Cormack, investment director for Enact, blamed the firm's financial difficulties on the so-called pasty tax introduced bythe chancellor, George Osborne in 2012 under which VAT was slapped on to hot takeaway food.</p><p>Pasties got a partial reprieve after marches in Cornwall led to a government U-turn under which food left to cool naturally was excluded. But firms such as West Cornwall, which keep their food hot, still have to pay.</p><p>Last year's hot summer was also bad news for hot food takeaways.</p><p>Cormack said: \"The business has struggled to cope with the effects of the pasty tax and a number of underperforming outlets.\"</p><p>But he added: \"Fundamentally, West Cornwall Pasty Company is a market-leading brand loved by millions of customers and we are delighted this transaction takes the brand and business forward.\"</p><p>West Cornwall Pasty Company, known as the \"posh man's Greggs\", is the first buyout for Enact.</p><p>Cormack said it was in advanced discussions with other businesses on deals it hopes to announce soon.</p><h2><strong>Recipe for success</strong></h2><p>Danny Mills became a Premier League regular in an era when a professional contract guaranteed entry to the millionaires club.</p><p>In a 13-year playing career that started in 1995, his clubs included Charlton Athletic, Leeds United and Manchester City.</p><p>Despite ahis tough-tackling reputation, Mills's defensive skills were highly rated enough by Sven Goran-Eriksson to make the Norwich-born defender his first-choice right back at the 2002 World Cup. Mills was the cause of a rare Eriksson meltdown in the opening game, when an error led to a Sweden equaliser and a flash of Scandinavian exasperation from the England bench.</p><p>After retiring in 2008, Mills, has proven to be become one of the game's most outspoken ex-professionals as a TV pundit. Last year, he was appointed to an eight-man Football Association commission tasked with improving the fortunes of the national team - to the surprise of some observers.</p><p>Mills's direct speaking style was deployed soon after, when he responded to criticism of the lack of female representation on the panel: \"People will argue that there was no woman named but do we have - at the moment - enough women with enough experience at this level because we are talking about the England senior team?\"  <strong>Dan Milmo </strong></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/434347498|2014-05-04T13:20:47Z|ca3cb41d5777f00cebd1581f1a09adac1240e3a9 -->",

        "headline":"Just imagine a Premier League that was truly made in Britain",
        "body":"<p>It is tempting to wonder at times what the Premier League is supposed to be for. It's obviously well presented. It's great fun to watch. It has even been tightly fought this season at the top end. Plus, of course, the Premier League is extremely good at projecting itself for financial gain across every surface and into every available niche like wet sand on the beach, or an aggressive fungal foot infection. But still. What is it actually meant to be about?</p><p>There were a couple of slightly jarring moments along these lines this week. First the news broke that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/08/micah-richards-leave-manchester-city-summer-despite-contract-offer\" title=\"\">Micah Richards is unlikely to stay</a> at Manchester City. It is a bit of a sad moment all round, and not just because Richards was once briefly but spectacularly the next big thing. He was bold and athletic and even quite dainty at times, romping about the place like a muscle-bound baby horse. At 17 he became the youngest defender to play for England. After which: not much. Richards played a bit. He still looked like a wonderful athlete and is clearly a nice, exuberant character. But the gearshift never came, the focus never narrowed.</p><p>He played 11 times for England as a teenager, and just twice in the past six years. But at 25 he still has time to come again, to become all the Micah Richards he can be. It is more of an issue for City, where Richards has been since the age of 14, and where he has a special significance as the only homegrown Englishman to play regularly since the boom years kicked in. City are trying to make this work and the academy may yet bear fruit. But for now it remains Micah or bust. And that thread is about to be cut.</p><p>Meanwhile <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/10/david-moyes-manchester-united-bayern-champions-league\" title=\"\">David Moyes said what he was expected to say</a> after defeat at Bayern Munich left Manchester United facing at least a year outside the Champions League. The plan was clear. Money would be spent. Big money. Players – big players, top players, big top players – were being lined up, with those rebuilding costs already climbing before our eyes. A while back £150m was being bandied about. This week that leapt to £200m. Then £300m. But why stop there? Why not £400m. Or £500m. Why not a billion? If the point of the Premier League really is to prove beyond all doubt that by spending enough money it is possible to employ human beings who are better than other, cheaper human beings at propelling a leather sphere into a netted rectangle, then there is no logical reason ever to stop spending. Or even to think about doing something else for a change.</p><p>This is not a criticism of City or of Moyes. It is instead a wider feature of the Premier League, which looks at times like a strangely barren field. This is a league that basically means nothing, producing the bare minimum of players, managers and hand-reared teams. Instead it can look sometimes like an elaborate piece of staging. We provide the fans, the heritage branding, the noise, the smell of mud. The rest of the world brings the ball.</p><p>Of the top teams Chelsea haven't produced a regular homegrown player since John Terry, who made his debut in 1998. United – who are, let's face it, all about the thrill of the homegrown – still have Danny Welbeck, Darren Fletcher and Ryan Giggs. Everton and Liverpool still produce players. Southampton provide a glorious example to the rest. Others chip in. But at the very top: almost nothing.</p><p>But then, why should the Premier League have any real interest in creating anything from within? Approaching its quarter-century, English football's top tier has become the most geographically non-specific of televisual products. In fact I can see no real reason why the whole thing couldn't in time be moved to China, where new stadiums could be built, huge crowds drawn, the branding retained, massive sponsorship attracted and no significant revenue or personnel supply lines interrupted.</p><p>Except, of course, that the Premier League is suffering on its own terms with this inability to refresh itself from within. If the sole point is to provide a winning product, Spain and Germany are winning that race, providing between them 11 of the past 16 Champions League semi-finalists.</p><p>This is obviously partly to do with wealth. But it also to do with methods and there is clear evidence that a spine of carefully nurtured home-reared players is what separates the very best from those who have just the outline or the deep pockets of an elite-level team, just as the current European champions are built around that enforced, academy-led spine of Thomas Müller, Toni Kroos, Philipp Lahm and Bastian Schweinsteiger.</p><p>In any case what are we supposed to make in the long term of an industry with revenues of £3bn that is essentially a gilded pop-up, with nothing to touch, or point to, or say: 'Look, we made these wonderful players, this thrilling, inspiring team that could not have existed otherwise.' I still remember the feeling of excitement at the talented group of players that emerged in the early Premier League years, a sense among the fizz and the puff of the new frontier that this was how these things were going to work now. A Paul Scholes every five years, regular Michael Owens scooting out from behind the skirting board, an occasional Micah Richards, fruits of a properly functioning system.</p><p>Sport has no wider story to tell if it doesn't at least attempt to express something of the cultures and systems behind it. Otherwise all that is being tested is the ability to spend. And how interesting is that, really?</p><p>Just imagine, for a moment if Moyes did say: \"Hang it all, what we're going to do is pour our millions into youth development. We're going to trust in the system, our basic resources, the galvanising romance of this wonderful big-city club. We're going to source our own organic world-class stars and we'll be back to storm the Champions League with Davie's Ducklings – maybe not now, but soon.\"</p><p>It won't happen of course. It couldn't. Money won't let it. But just imagine if it did: the thrill of something tangible being built, the sense at last of some content beneath the glittering surface.</p><p>• This article was updated on 11 April, correcting 'occidental' to 'occasional'</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/434316009|2014-05-04T13:20:47Z|bc36642c59a3d578d330dd4c1b689dd7ce9059a6 -->",

        "body":"<p>Hark! What is that noise? That rhythmical banging sound? Actually, it sounds pretty good. Nice beat to it. What tub is being thumped to make the Rumour Mill do that saucy little dance that we promised we would never do again? Why, it's Davie Moyes, smacking the side of an empty Gazprom drum (he won't have any need for it for a while), trying to draw attention to the ragtag collection of footballers strewn across the Old Trafford lawn.</p><p></p><p>Yes, indeed, there's a sale on in Manchester. All must go and you can get some half-competent athletes for a very reasonable price. And <strong>Rio Ferdinand</strong>, too. You thought we were going to say <strong>Tom Cleverley</strong> there, didn't you? No; that's cheap, it's obvious and we want more than that. It seems Davie is up for a good clear-out to make room in his garage for a <strong>Toni Kroos</strong>, meaning that (breathe) as well as Nemanja Vidic leaving, <strong>Ferdinand, Cleverley, Shinji Kagawa, Patrice Evra, Ryan Giggs, Alex Buttner, Anderson, Nani, Ashley Young, Albert the kitman, Fred the Red, the waxwork model they've been putting in Bobby Charlton's seat, Gary Neville's Alex Ferguson teddy bear, Michael Knighton, at least two of the Glazer brothers, the first three attempts at the Fergie statue</strong> and <strong>Steve Round</strong> are all available to anyone who expresses an interest.</p><p></p><p>Along the road in Liverpool, Brendan Rodgers has told a group of spotty boys not to touch what they can't afford. Or, to move slightly away from the language of teenage girls and more towards that of football, he has issued a hands-off warning. On whom are people wishing to place their hands? Daniel Sturridge? Luis Suàrez? Raheem Sterling? Brad Jones?</p><p>No, it seems people <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/10/brendan-rodgers-psychiatrist-liverpool-steve-peters\" title=\"\">are keen to poach the <strong>psychologist Steve Peters</strong></a>, the man who has seemingly very effectively hypnotised the whole Liverpool squad into believing they're no longer rubbish. That's not all Brendan has been doing though – he had a pair of eyes (someone else's – he doesn't have a spare set of his own … ) watching Benfica's <strong>Lazar Markovic</strong> against AZ Alkmaar in the Europa League, and as yer man only played for 20 minutes, it might not exactly have been the most worthwhile trip in the world. Still, nice jolly to Lisbon, eh?</p><p></p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/10/thibaut-courtois-atletico-madrid-chelsea-champions-league\" title=\"\"><strong>Thibaut Courtois</strong> is crying into his waffles this morning</a>, and not only because he can see Atlético Madrid's season that promised so much tumbling into heartbreaking nothingness on the last day of the season, when they face Barcelona, the inevitable madcap 4-4 draw handing the title to Real Madrid. No, it's because unless he signs a new contract with new clauses with Chelsea, he won't be able to play against them in the Champions League. We don't pretend to understand quite why that would be the case – and nor should you. Don't even try. Have a waffle.</p><p></p><p>Hot young buck <strong>Samuel Eto'o</strong> is seemingly sick of José Mourinho constantly saying he's a no-good geriatric and is readying himself to do one to Turkey, where Besiktas have laid out a very attractive two-year contract offer, which will of course keep the spry striker in Istanbul until he's 23.</p><p></p><p>Newcastle are plotting. Plotting! We guess Alan Pardew, Mike Ashley and Joe Kinnear (you thought he was gone? Pah! Joe is never gone) are huddled around a candle, having met in a darkened chamber at the dead of night, poring over a parchment on which there are but two words scrawled with a quill. Those two words are <strong>'Joel Campbell'</strong>. The Magpies want Manchester United-slayer Campbell and given that the perpetual Arsenal loanee has scored only eight goals in 30 games for Olympiakos this season, we imagine he'll fit right in at St James' Park. Arsenal will respond to this crippling blow by having a good old look at Everton defender <strong>John Stones</strong>, who has impressed all and sundry since breaking into the team  this season.</p><p></p><p><strong>Lewis Holtby</strong> seems like a lovely young man. The sort that you'd be delighted to bring home to meet your parents. He'd be polite, say that dinner was lovely even if pa has overcooked the chicken and ma has made the gravy all lumpy, and then he'd do the washing up, not just out of politeness but because he genuinely wants to help. He's got lovely hair, too. Nice strong arms. And those ey … sorry, erm, miles away for a second. What were we saying? Oh yeah, he wants to stay at Tottenham next season.</p><p></p><p>And finally, in perhaps the most pathetic thing that your humble Rumour Mill has heard or seen since those Chelsea fans discovered how to use crayons and A4 paper, a group of quite possibly the same Chelsea fans want to have a whip-round to pay <strong>Mourinho's naughty boy fine</strong>. Good lord.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/434286462|2014-05-04T13:20:47Z|fa24ff798a32372eaa4a663557bfe980e9263c75 -->",

        "body":"<p>To tempt an elite player into joining next season's rebuilding at Manchester United, the prospect of the Europa League (or no European football at all) is not the greatest card David Moyes could hold.</p><p>\"We're looking to spend the right money on players who are available and it's not anything to do with the Champions League,\" he said after United's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/09/bayern-munich-manchester-united-champions-league-match-report\" title=\"\">quarter-final defeat to Bayern Munich</a>. \"Any players we've quietly discussed it with are more than happy to join Manchester United. They know it's not a long-term thing. My focus is on getting a side together to get back in the Champions League.\"</p><p>Moyes could hardly have said anything else. Part of his remit is public tub-thumping and putting on a brave face as he starts the greatest overhaul of a United squad since Sir Alex Ferguson broke up the drinking culture at the club in the late 1980s.</p><p>Moyes must replace Nemanja Vidic, who will leave in the close season, plus Rio Ferdinand (probably) and most likely Patrice Evra – a big void to fill. He has also to add at least one European-class, game-shaping midfielder. Bayern's Toni Kroos would be a good start but how to prise him from the runaway Bundesliga title-winners and a club that could become the first to retain the European Cup during the Champions League era?</p><p>Oh, and Moyes has to decide who is worth keeping of Shinji Kagawa, Antonio Valencia, Ashley Young, Javier Hernández, Darren Fletcher, Alexander Buttner, Nani, and Ryan Giggs.</p><p>It would be a huge challenge for a man of Ferguson's experience. For Moyes, still a novice United manager, and the executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward, still a novice transfer-market operator, the task appears Sisyphean.</p><p>With no Champions League football and a side who have been in near free-fall, Moyes and Woodward are propagating a particular mantra. This states that it is United's rich history that players of the ilk of Kroos and Southampton's Luke Shaw will take into account and not the threadbare squad whose feeble championship defence has left them 17 points behind Liverpool, and seven from fourth place with five matches left.</p><p>Any stellar footballer would need to be convinced that Moyes is the man to lead United back into another gilded age of Premier League and Champions League domination. At the moment, the club executive remains unyielding in its belief. As the summer draws nearer Moyes will be trusted with the best part of £150m.</p><p>Barring a near-miracle, the earliest United will next take part in the Champions League is the 2015-16 campaign. Putting aside how a season can feel an age to a footballer whose sense of self is bolstered by performing against top continental sides, will Moyes really be able to attract what is needed?</p><p>Moyes and Woodward have seen this coming from virtually the moment the 50-year-old took over from Ferguson. The manager's use of \"hope\" rather than \"will\" when talking of United's prospects has been a public hint of the prevailing view inside the club that the squad are not up to it.</p><p>In part, this is what has bought Moyes time but after last summer's farrago in the transfer market he and Woodward have had a full season to ensure those mistakes are rectified.</p><p>To do so, Moyes and Woodward are trying to adopt the European model of closing deals six months in advance. This is to avoid engaging in another summer of horse-trading like that which embarrassed the club last year when Cesc Fábregas, Leighton Baines, Fábio Coentraõ and Ander Herrera all failed to join for various reasons.</p><p>The word is that one or two deals are well on the way to completion. So for proof of the strategy's success expect new faces to be smiling for the cameras sooner rather than later.</p><p>The big conundrum is what happens to the hope of regaining Champions League status at the first attempt if the new players are not of the requisite quality.</p><p>How will this affect the balance of power in English football? And how will this impact on the future of Moyes himself?</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/434230898|2014-05-04T13:20:47Z|bacdf2359b14e839f17eb7bdd623b1bcb69991f5 -->",

If they are to progress to the semi-finals, you get the feeling just one goal almost certainly won't be enough. <br />But United can take heart from the fact that Arsenal, Manchester City and Chelsea have all beaten Bayern on their own patch since 2012, a state of affairs United manager David Moyes suspects will prey on the minds of their players and hopes to use to his advantage. you can read his thoughts on the matter in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/apr/08/manchester-united-english-bayern-munich-allianz-arena-champions-league\">this preview by Jamie Jackson</a>.<br /><p>With Robin van Persie sidelined through injury, United will be hoping for a big performance from Wayne Rooney, who will <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/08/manchester-united-wayne-rooney-bayern-munich-champions-league\">receive a painkilling injection in his injured toe ahead of tonight's match</a>. Marouane Fellaini, Rafael and Jonny Evans were all missing from the United squad that flew out to Germany, while Ryan Giggs and Patrice Evra made the plane, but may not be fit enough to play.</p><p>Bayern go into the game without Bastian Schweinsteiger, who is suspended after being sent off in the first leg, while defender Javi Martinez will join him on the naughty step. Thiago Alcantara is also unlikely to feature, as he is still suffering from a knee injury sustained in Bayern's draw against Hoffenheim two weekends ago. </p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-7e965850-ddee-446f-b6e9-e43ee5fcccf8\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/4/9/1397064362151/c0ef8b63-c971-456f-aa5e-2c17a7ee9695-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Bayern Munich v Manchester United\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>My eyes!

        "body":"<h2>CHANGING HIS MIND</h2><p>Asks Dave Jones: <strong>\"I was at the Sheffield United v Brentford match, in which the Blades' Kieron Freeman was wrongly sent off, and a penalty wrongly awarded to Brentford, only for referee Eddie Ilderton to then revoke both decisions after consulting with his linesman and award a drop ball in the penalty area. Come half-time the question everyone on the Kop was asking was: has this ever happened before? Can the Knowledge help?\"</strong></p><p>The Knowledge can most certainly help, if not on an incident as specific as that, but on the issue of referees changing their minds. In fact, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2003/nov/27/theknowledge.sport\" title=\"\">Knowledge from November 2003</a> can give a few examples, such as Spanish referee José María García-Aranda, who awarded a penalty against Liverpool's Markus Babbel in their Uefa Cup (ask your slightly older brother) match against Roma in 2001, only to not just change his mind, but deny he had even given the decision in the first place.</p><p>A more recent example, and one slightly closer to the scenario at Sheffield United, came just this season, when Andy D'Urso awarded Exeter City a penalty during injury-time of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FB5XUuB7UFE\" title=\"\">their game against Morecambe</a> after David Wheeler fell to the turf. Something of a stramash ensued as the Shrimps protested, during which Morecambe's Jamie Devitt was sent off for head-butting an opponent, only for D'Urso to have a word with his assistant, change his mind about the penalty and instead book Wheeler for diving. \"I have just watched it on HD and it was a definite penalty,\" said Exeter's cravat-sporting boss Paul Tisdale afterwards. \"We get the rough end of things and it is just not fair. We try and play to the rules and we are seen as a soft touch, so referees and linesmen can make these decisions.\"</p><p>Examples of referees changing their minds over red cards are a little rarer but one came back in 2006 during the big Caribbean Premier League clash between Youth Milan and Caribsurf Paradise, when the referee Mark Bob Forde showed a red card to Youth Milan's captain Michael Forde (no relation, hopefully), before having a little think and then downgrading it to a yellow. According to Barbados newspaper <a href=\"http://barpublish.bits.baseview.com/story/308108489426826.php\" title=\"\">the Nation</a>: \"There was no contact between the two opposing players but referee Forde, who was not feeling well and even had to stop the game at one stage to leave the field, pulled the dreaded red card from his pocket.\" As an aside, Forde was given a warning <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/oct/14/fifa-bans-caribbean-officials-corruption\" title=\"\">in the 2011 Fifa investigation into bribery</a> that led to Mohamed Bin Hammam being banned for life.</p><p><em>Can you think of any more extreme examples of referees doing the reverse ferret? Email </em><a href=\"mailto:knowledge@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><em>knowledge@theguardian.com</em></a><em>.</em></p><h2>THE BIGGEST GAP</h2><p><strong>\"Kicking around on some French football sites, I noticed that Jérôme Rothen, a winger mostly known for his days at PSG, was in Ligue 2's team of the year in 1999-2000, and again in 2011-12,\"</strong> mused Eric Devin <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/02/first-player-to-wear-fluorescent-boots\" title=\"\">last week</a>. <strong>\"This stretch between being named to one all-division team and then another at the same level must surely be a record? Of note here are Wayne Bridge (2001-02 Premier League, 2012‑13 Championship) and Michael Carrick, (2003-04 Championship, 2012-13 Premier League) but extensive Wikipedia trawling finds no such gap between appearances at the same level in Italy, Spain, England or Germany. Is Monsieur Rothen the holder of this somewhat dubious record?\"</strong></p><p>Warren Lyons was straight in, writing: \"I'm afraid Eric Devin didn't look close enough. Chris Turner, a goalkeeper who played for Sunderland and Manchester United in the 1980s and won the League Cup with Sheffield Wednesday in 1991, was in the PFA Third Division team of the year in 1978-79 during his first spell with Wednesday. Thirteen seasons later, playing for Leyton Orient &nbsp;at the tail-end of his career, he was again named in the 1991-92 Third Division PFA team of the year.</p><p>\"Gareth Ainsworth, the current Wycombe manager, can go one better. He was named in the Third Division (or fourth-tier) PFA Team of the Year in 1996-97 when playing for Lincoln City. Fast forward 14 seasons, and a 37-year-old Gareth Ainsworth found himself in the League Two (fourth tier) PFA 2010-11 team of the year while playing for Wycombe Wanderers.\"</p><p>Other similar gaps saw Ian Harte selected for the 2011-12 League One XI, 12 years after appearing in the Premier League side, Lee Hughes made the cut for the 1998-99 First Division (second tier) team then the 2009-10 League Two side, while Kenny Sansom (who holds the record for most appearances in PFA teams of the year with 11) first appeared in the 1976-77 Third Division side, and was still around for the 1986-87 First Division (top tier) team.</p><p>However, Mikkel Orlovski has perhaps the definitive suggestion: \"On Eric's question, I had to check Ryan Giggs's record. After he was repositioned as playmaker a few years ago, he's had somewhat of a renaissance and was duly awarded with a spot in the 2008-09 PFA Team of the Year. His first appearance in the selection was as an explosive winger way back in 1992-93.\"</p><p><em>Can anyone beat a gap of 16 years? </em><a href=\"mailto:knowledge@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><em>Drop us a line at the usual address</em></a><em>.</em></p><h2>BOOT-ALICIOUS (2)</h2><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/02/first-player-to-wear-fluorescent-boots\" title=\"\"><strong>Last week we thought that the first instance of yellow boots on the football pitch came in November 1996</strong></a><strong>, but as ever you resourceful lot have dipped further back into the archives …</strong></p><p>Simon Lindberg writes: \"In Sweden yellow boots have been a bad omen since Kennet Andersson wore them and missed a penalty in a World Cup qualifier against Austria at home in October 1996. We lost the game 1-0 and didn't qualify for France as a direct result of that missed penalty. And the curse continued: \"Funny thing (or unfunny if you're Swedish) is that 13 years later the current saviour of Arsenal, Kim Källström, missed a penalty in a World Cup qualifier against Denmark at home. We lost that game 1-0, making us miss a major tournament for the first time since 1998. It was also the first time Sweden lost in a qualifier at our National Stadium since that game in October 1996. Kim was, of course, wearing yellow boots. After Kim's miss Kennet Andersson commented that yellow boots should be forbidden in the Swedish national team. What Zlatan said as he watched Kim miss the penalty is unclear but there might have been some profanity.\"</p><p>Last week's suggestion for the pioneer of the luminous footwear was Attila Sekerlioglu, an Austrian midfielder who turned out a few times for St Johnstone, and the man himself has been in touch to confirm exactly when he donned the luminous footwear. He saved it for a special occasion, specifically the Scottish Challenge Cup final on 3 November 1996, but alas his shiny feet couldn't guide the Saints to a win – Stranraer beat them 1-0 to lift the trophy. \"My boot sponsor 'Basry Sports' gave them to me,\" says Attila, revealing that remarkably, in the football dressing room where \"banter\" and \"stick\" rule all, his team-mates and even opponents didn't really give him a hard time. \"I was the only one I thought. If I think back, Paolo Di Canio wore a green and a white boot at Celtic, but a year later maybe.\" Speaking of which: \"Di Canio wore different ones all the time,\" parps up Stephen Hart. \"Pantofola d'Oro were the company who made them. He wore a golden pair as a one-off on 26 December 1996 away to Aberdeen, scored the winner, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jieM-HHBLg0\" title=\"\">and ran to the camera</a>.\"</p><p>But we can go back further. \"Enzo Scifo wore red boots at USA 94,\" notes Ben Keane, who provides <a href=\"http://cdn.c.photoshelter.com/img-get/I0000ZU8f0CLFNl0/s/860/860/Enzo-Scifo-2-7-94.jpg\" title=\"\">this image as evidence</a>. <a href=\"mailto:knowledge@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><em>Any more for any more</em></a>?</p><h2>KNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE</h2><p><strong>\"I know Steve Nicol did it in 1987, but has a defender ever scored a hat-trick in the top flight?\"</strong> asked <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2004/dec/01/theknowledge.sport\" title=\"\">Daniel Kee way back in December 2004</a>.</p><p>The short answer Daniel is no, neither before or after you posed that question nearly a decade ago. The Knowledge <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/oct/30/the-knowledge-premier-league-minutes-goals\" title=\"\">covered hat-trick scoring full-backs</a> a few months ago, and as it says there the closest we can give you in the top flight is utility man Steve Watson, who spent much of his time playing at the back and bagged three for Everton in their 4-0 win over Leeds in 2003 (reported rather forlornly by <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/3122928.stm\" title=\"\">the BBC</a> as \"Everton rout sad Leeds\"), but he lined up in midfield that day.</p><p>As did Nicol, a defender by trade when scoring three for Liverpool against Newcastle in 1987, so the last man to get a treble from defence in the English top flight was his Liverpool team-mate Gary Gillespie, who scored thrice against Birmingham back in 1986. Earlier that month Alvin Martin took home the match ball as West Ham spanked Newcastle 8-1, and even more absurdly those three goals were scored against three different goalkeepers. Starting keeper Martin Thomas, already carrying a shoulder injury, conceded Martin's first and then three others before throwing in the towel at half-time, with midfielder Chris Hedworth taking over between the sticks. However, Hedworth barely had time to let in Martin's second before cracking his collarbone, meaning one Peter Beardsley had to take the gloves, just in time for Martin to complete his hat-trick from the penalty spot.</p><p>\"That was a special moment,\" Martin told <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/dec/16/alvin-martin-small-talk\" title=\"\">Small Talk</a> a couple of years ago. \"You probably recognise the implication of it later on. I remember scoring a goal and then the keeper going off, and then I got another one, but I couldn't remember if I'd scored them against different keepers. I didn't know that until the crowd started shouting my name when we got a penalty at 7-1. Ray Stewart picked the ball up and the crowd started shouting my name, so they were aware that I was on a hat-trick against three different goalkeepers.\"</p><p>In more recent times, Werder Bremen's Brazilian defender Naldo scored a hat-trick in their 6-2 victory over Eintracht Frankfurt in 2006, Fernando Hierro achieved the feat for Real Madrid back in 2002, while spicy set-piece specialist Sinisa Mihajlovic scored <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTN54vUayCM\" title=\"\">three free-kicks for Lazio against Sampdoria in 1998</a>. Quite a player, was Mihajlovic – it's just a shame about, well, you know, all that other stuff.</p><h2>CAN YOU HELP?</h2><p>\"After Nike pushed up the price of an England shirt so far beyond the point of being acceptable it's almost laughable at £90, could you map the evolution of the pricing for the England kit? There must have been some very, very steep jumps in its cost over the last 20 years, for example\" – Josh Fleming.</p><p>\"Has any team ever gone an entire season with just draws? No losses, no wins just draws?\" – Leon McLeod.</p><p>\"As a child I watched Serbia &amp; Montenegro v Tunisia at the 2004 Olympic football tournament, when a penalty for Tunisia was repeated by the referee seven or eight times,\" tweets grbomadjija. \"Unfortunately I can't find video but I remember we lost 3-2. Is it the record for repeating one penalty?\"</p><p>\"Could you help settle an argument between myself (Liverpool) and my friend (Manchester United).

        "headline":"Manchester United must look to past English success to conquer Bayern",
        "body":"<p>Manchester United should look no further than Chelsea, Manchester City and Arsenal  – on two occasions – for how to execute a successful raid on Bayern Munich.</p><p>With <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/01/manchester-united-bayern-munich-champions-league-match-report\" title=\"\">the Champions League quarter-final poised at 1-1</a> after last week's first leg at Old Trafford, David Moyes's team need to score at the Allianz Arena on Wednesday eveningor they will be knocked out by Pep Guardiola's team of pass-and-move masters.</p><p>Yet do not expect a gung-ho attacking mentality as United try to become the fourth Premier League club in succession to silence the Bavarians in their own house. Moyes will look at how these results were achieved and have his natural instinct to set up teams in hard-to-beat fashion, with an emphasis on counterattacking confirmed.</p><p>Arsenal, Manchester City and Chelsea have all beaten Bayern at the Allianz Arena since 2012, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/11/bayern-munich-arsenal-champions-league-match-report\" title=\"\">with the Gunners also managing a draw in last month's round-of-16 tie</a>.</p><p>In all of these the story was how Bayern had superiority in possession and territory yet enjoyed no happy ending. Moyes believes this could affect them.</p><p>\"It would be something which is more in Bayern's mind, that the English teams have come here and got a good record,\" says the Scot.</p><p>\"They will have that doubt in their mind. They are European champions but they will have the games they have played against English teams in mind. We will try to use it to our advantage.\"</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/may/19/bayern-munich-chelsea-champions-league-final\" title=\"\">Chelsea's victory came in a 2012 Champions League final</a> of cat-and-mouse that was goalless until Thomas Müller struck on 83 minutes before Didier Drogba's equaliser presaged a famous penalty shootout victory to secure the trophy.</p><p>While Arjen Robben, Franck Ribèry and co dominated the ball, Roberto Di Matteo's Chelsea proved to be dogged opponents. With Drogba the lone striker, the team took up almost permanent camp near their area.</p><p>Arsène Wenger eschewed his penchant for swashbuckling play in Arsenal's last-16 win in the 2012-13 competition, and the draw during the current campaign, and informed his side they should defer  to Bayern then hope to punish them on the break.</p><p>In December Manuel Pellegrini sent his City side out in Bavaria in a cautious formation that had a five-man midfield and Edin Dzeko as the lone attacker. Going 2-0 down after only 12 minutes forced the visitors' hand and was the catalyst for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/dec/10/bayern-munich-manchester-city-champions-league\" title=\"\">a famous comeback win, 3-2</a>.</p><p>Last week Moyes did a similar number on Guardiola at Old Trafford. The Scot packed the midfield with Michael Carrick, Ryan Giggs, Marouane Fellaini, Danny Welbeck and Antonio Valencia, the latter two being asked to protect the full-backs, Phil Jones and Alexander Büttner. While Jupp Heynckes was in charge of Bayern for Chelsea's victory and Arsenal's win, Guardiola's personal score at the Allianz against English opposition is drawn one, lost one.</p><p>The Spaniard's CV also features Chelsea's 2012 semi-final win against his Barcelona team, when the London club defended a 1-0 first leg advantage by drawing 2-2 at the Camp Nou.</p><p>When Bayern's record in their last four outings against English opposition is put to Guardiola he offers a clear explanation. \"They are so defensive teams and use the counter action very well.</p><p>\"That is why it's always difficult when one team stays there just to defend, to wait until you make a mistake,\" the 43-year-old says. \"They come to defend and wait for the counterattack. Maybe I am wrong, maybe David Moyes thinks another thing, but I think they are going to wait back with eight or nine players in the box, await our mistake and wait for a free-kick or a corner to punish us.\"</p><p>Bastian Schweinsteiger's away strike means United must score. Yet listening to Wayne Rooney speak only reiterates the sense of a team preparing for a repeat hit-and-run strategy.</p><p>Recalling the semi-final in United's triumphant 2007-08 Champions League campaign, he says: \"There are times when teams are better than you but you've got to adapt the way you play to try and beat then. When we played Barcelona away, in 2008, I remember playing right wing, with Owen Hargreaves at right-back and we had [Eric] Abidal and [Andrés] Iniesta against us. I remember thinking: 'Jesus! I've got to do this.'</p><p>\"It was a long night but we defended very well, got the 0-0 and won 1-0 in the return.\"</p><p>Questioned why it will be different this time against an English team, Guardiola is defiant.</p><p>\"We are playing at the Allianz Arena, so that is an important point. We have got to make sure we keep our form,\" he says. \"We had five or six really good chances there and Manchester United had just one for the [Nemanja] Vidic goal. They didn't have any other chances.\"</p><p>Here, Guardiola forgets Danny Welbeck's disallowed finish and the golden chance he spurned when chipping straight at Manuel Neuer.</p><p>How did this latter opportunity materialise? By United waiting for the right moment, springing the counter and releasing Welbeck, whose pace took him behind Bayern with ease.</p><p>Expect this to be attempted again on Wednesday. And expect a riveting evening if Welbeck – or any United player – can this time convert.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/434055601|2014-05-04T13:20:47Z|5ee191bcb0bb9ab8fb4815c6b552fba4480c0f25 -->",

        "headline":"Manchester United: how did they get into this mess?",
        "body":"<p>When it comes to football and talk of crisis, it is always best to take the long view. This is, after all, an industry that is pretty much always in crisis, sirens howling, warning lights on, seawater lapping around your ankles, where the band just carries on tinkling away and people keep turning up on deck asking where the party is. On Wednesday night, Manchester United will play Bayern Munich in the quarter finals of the Champions League at the illuminated sunken space-doughnut that is the <a href=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0e/Allianz_Arena_Pahu.jpg\" title=\"\">Allianz Arena</a>, a fixture of such glamour it is almost tempting to forget that United are, by all reports, a club in crisis.</p><p>Indeed, over the last few months the ongoing crisis of Manchester United has been discussed so widely it has become an object of daily fascination, like the weather forecast, or the collapse of Ukraine. This is the way of these things now. Consumed by rolling news and social media, English football finds itself in the grip of an unceasing background din. It is a place where enraged public opinion has become an event in itself, and where everybody on every side of the argument is simultaneously distraught and consumed with gurgling triumphalism pretty much all the time.</p><p>And yet, for all the talk, there are plenty of questions to be answered as Britain's most celebrated football club of the last 20 years embarks on its date among the Euro-giants. Are United really in crisis? If so, is this the kind of crisis most people seem to imagine – a business of botched succession and managed corporate shrinkage – or another, more insidious, kind of crisis altogether? All that is certain right now is that it seems to matter, on some level, to a great many people.</p><p>In outline the facts of United's case are fairly plain. The team has struggled on the pitch and in the transfer window from the moment last July when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2013/may/09/david-moyes-manchester-united-alex-ferguson\" title=\"\">David Moyes was first unveiled as Alex Ferguson's replacement</a>, posing for the cameras by the home dugout with a pallid grimace of a smile, like some incredulous new father about to wander out of the maternity unit for the first time with his papoose on upside down.</p><p>United have lost 10 times in the Premier League this season and will fail to finish in the top four for the first time in 23 years. They have been repeatedly cuffed aside by more powerful Premier League opponents. More bafflingly, their football has been callow and cautious, lacking in a familiar sense of United-tinged dash. And tellingly it is this change of tone that appears to have been most disorientating. Football teams will lose, empires will crumble, but there is a deeper sense of status-anxiety here. Historically, United have been portrayed as a kind of footballing Camelot, its greatest teams providing an ideal of youthful attacking brio, a vehicle for a terribly seductive kind of red-shirted romance.</p><p>This is the key to the United identity, although in reality this sense of fearless attacking vim has diminished in recent years as the late stages of Alex Ferguson's time in charge coincided with some cautious, austerity-era winning football. But under Moyes, a worthy if unremarkable organiser, a curtain seems to have been swished aside, behind which this state-of-the-art United stand revealed as ... well, something that doesn't particularly look like United any more.</p><figure data-media-id=\"gu-image-434051990\"><img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/4/8/1396972608521/David-Moyes-011.jpg\" alt=\"David Moyes\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /><figcaption>David Moyes: looks like a man trying to navigate the Martian criminal underworld with a boy scout compass. Photograph: John Powell/Liverpool FC via Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>Some odd things have begun to happen. A fortnight ago, a group of supporters chartered a plane to fly over Old Trafford <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2014/mar/30/david-moyes-thanks-fans-despite-aeroplane-banner-video\" title=\"\">trailing the message &quot;Wrong One – Moyes Out&quot;</a> and were loudly booed by most of those in the stadium, which became mini-headline news in itself. In January, a Manchester resident was <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0O1HbZzLepI\" title=\"\">recorded calling 999 and demanding to speak to Alex Ferguson</a> after a particularly galling defeat by Sunderland. This too was widely reported. Meanwhile, at every fresh turn, the channels are jammed with grief, outrage, frantic reassurances. Why is this news? Or, more precisely, why is it such big news?</p><p>Partly, this seems to be simply a function of longevity, and perhaps even of a collective sense of <em>ubi sunt</em> nostalgia. Under Ferguson, United dominated the Premier League, as inaugural champions of the rebranded top tier in 1993 and its most visible presence for the next 20 years. There are currently adults alive who weren't born the last time United were anything other than an all-devouring machine fronted up by an immutable gum-chewing Scotsman.</p><p>Plus, of course, football itself changed during the years of Peak United, transformed into a relentlessly intrusive media event and generally entwining itself around everything like an aggressively territorial knotweed. Hate it, loathe it or feel utterly indifferent toward it, you can no longer simply ignore English football, to the extent that failing to be affected by United's decline, even as a vague sense of something distantly happening, of insistent concerns felt only by others, is now almost impossible.</p><p>But then United have always been an object of wider fascination, a shared sporting jewel, calling forth those familiar glimmers of English football's romantic big-city industrial past. With United, the postwar years brought the founding legend of Matt Busby's great teams of the 1950s and 60s, torn apart by the Munich plane disaster, then rebuilt with impossibly inspiring circularity to become champions of Europe.</p><p>More recently, the 90s saw the dawning of the second great age of United, spurred on by the gold-rush years of the early Premier League. Floated on the stock exchange in 1990, with a stadium in Salford that could be enlarged without planning-law restrictions, United were in the right place at exactly the right time: rich, brilliantly managed and blessed with a group of bespoke homegrown players including the dreamy talents of Paul Scholes and Ryan Giggs. David Beckham, in particular, was a gift to a Premier League hungry for heroes, a gorgeous golden dufus-child all of its own, and a poster boy for those expansionist ambitions.</p><p>And so Fergie-era United became unavoidably associated with the plastic boom times of the 90s, a decade when Tony Blair looked like an exciting young progressive prime minister in waiting and Manchester itself was recast as a modern metropolitan city, its industrial heart energetically transformed along the loft-bar-boutique model. Even now, on matchdays, Old Trafford has a rolling playlist from the baggy, fuzzy, dreamily insouciant Manchester music scene of the 90s. Bayern Munich fans have their oompah band. Barcelona have the Catalan celebration hymn. United have <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCWqb63gX0Q\" title=\"\">This is the One</a> by the Stone Roses and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVGf3ePIO04\" title=\"\">I'm Free</a> by the Soup&nbsp;Dragons.</p><p>It is perhaps this sense of having come to the end, not just of an era, but of that era, so closely associated with the prosperous, pre-crash teenage years of many people now in their 30s and 40s, that makes United's dip feel significant even for those who might otherwise have no wider interest. The 90s are done. The credit ran out. And now even Manchester United seem cowed, another British institution in a&nbsp;state of retreat.</p><p>Plus, of course, there is an element of soap opera here too, most notable in an oddly gripping parable of succession. Taking over after 27 years from arguably <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/may/12/sir-alex-ferguson-old-trafford\" title=\"\">the most successful British manager of all time</a> always looked like a near-impossible job. Jos&eacute; Mourinho was the obvious choice, one of the top coaches in world football and a man who projects the kind of cartoonishly maniacal self-possession required to cast off the weight of an overbearing predecessor. On his way out at Real Madrid, Mourinho was gettable too. And yet United looked elsewhere, amid some slightly puzzling talk about Mourinho being simply not a United type, a controversialist, a trash-talker, a personage of&nbsp;insufficient fibre.</p><figure data-media-id=\"gu-image-434051991\"><img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/4/8/1396972176061/Alex-Ferguson-2013-011.jpg\" alt=\"Alex Ferguson, 2013\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /><figcaption>Alex Ferguson salutes fans after his final game in charge of United, May 2013. Photograph: Nick Potts/PA</figcaption></figure><p>Instead, Ferguson hand-picked his successor, plucking from the throng a well-organised, honourable man who had never managed at an elite-level club, never won a trophy, and who even now seems frazzled and jumpy just standing on the touchline at old Trafford, arms flailing, whirling around as though feeling at his back some silent, trailing spectre.</p><p>It is here that the sense of sentimental hubris around the appointment of Moyes begins to seep in. Ferguson has always drawn a certain theatrical power from his access to British football's shared managerial myth kitty, the&nbsp;rock'n'roll years of the formative Scottish giants Matt Busby, Bill Shankly and Jock Stein. Even in his wine-loving multimillionaire pomp, Ferguson retained a shade of this pared-back authenticity. Moyes has its imprint too. Ferguson was coached by his father, David Sr, as a boy in Drumchapel. And Moyes himself is another chiselled, stately Glasgow disciplinarian, not to mention a committed Christian who infuriated at&nbsp;least one teammate at Cambridge United by discussing Bible teachings in&nbsp;the dressing room.</p><p>This sense of retro, straight-backed decency is probably Moyes's defining quality. The idea that it makes him a like-for-like replacement for the great dictator is alarmingly off key, like a commemorative portrait of some gnarled and politicking Renaissance machiavel recreated on canvas as a milk-white model of piety. In his peak years, Ferguson was above all a pragmatist and a brilliantly effective agent of the dark arts, stretching the rules to his advantage, intimidating opponents and dominating the media. Mourinho may have provided an unflattering reflection, but he understands this world perfectly. Moyes can perhaps adapt and grow into his outsized role. But for now he still looks like a man trying to navigate the Martian criminal underworld with a boy scout compass and a map of rural Buckinghamshire. Little wonder it is all so horribly watchable.</p><p>In a sense, though, Ferguson-Moyes is no more than a sub-plot here. The fact is United have been a decelerating juggernaut for several years now, experiencing a period of declining momentum that began in earnest the moment <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/jun/11/cristiano-ronaldo-manchester-united-real-madrid1\" title=\"\">Cristiano Ronaldo was allowed to leave the club for a world-record fee</a>, with the money largely swallowed up by debt repayments. There is a fascinating commercial paradox to this. On the face of it, United's decade-long ownership by US retail magnates and all-round billionaire wheeler-dealers the Glazer family has been a wonderful success. The brand? Well, the brand has never been quite so energetically hammered. United currently have a staggering 35 official sponsors, including Aon, DHL, Nike, Chevrolet, Singha (official beer), Bulova (official timekeeper), Mister Potato (official savoury snack partner) and Namee (official noodles partner, Asia, Oceania and Middle East). Last year, the club announced record second-quarter revenue of &pound;122.9m. Phew! Trebles all round!</p><p>Except, there is of course a separate game going on here. In reality, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/david-conn-inside-sport-blog/2014/jan/25/manchester-united-glazers-david-conn\" title=\"\">the Glazers are sweating their heavily leveraged asset as hard as they possibly can</a>, haemorrhaging interest payments and drawing down huge cash dividends from a club bought almost entirely in loans secured against itself. It is a brilliantly worked, gravity-defying exercise in corporate plate-spinning, at&nbsp;the end of which we have a club still somehow staggering on down the main street of elite European football with its hands clasped to its chest, banknotes fluttering out from under its waistcoat, a piece of cloth with the word &quot;bang!&quot; dangling from its six-gun.</p><figure data-media-id=\"gu-image-434051992\"><img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/4/8/1396971897209/Manchester-United-beat-Li-011.jpg\" alt=\"Manchester United beat Liverpool 1999\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /><figcaption>Winning streak: Paul Scholes, David Beckham, Roy Keane, Andy Cole and Ryan Giggs celebrate beating Liverpool in the fourth round of the 1999 FA Cup. Photograph: Michael Steele/Empics Sports Photo Agency</figcaption></figure><p>The team has naturally suffered. While other clubs spend the improbable millions of their carbon-magnate owners, at United key players have been allowed to age in situ, with spending significantly scaled back before the isolated panic buys of the past six months. For a club of stars, United lack stars. Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie are grizzled A-listers, but Rooney has been at the club for a decade and Van Persie is 30. Even Old Trafford itself has begun to look a little jaded, its surfaces worn, facilities unrevamped since the 90s. During the home leg against Bayern Munich last week, one German photographer, crammed into the tiny snapper's hutch with a microwave pie in his hand, was asked if it was his first visit to Old Trafford. &quot;Isn't it wonderful?&quot; he was asked. The photographer politely kept his counsel.</p><p>The irony, of course, is that United are victims here of a situation they helped create. So broad was their profile, so thorough the Premier League's marketing triumph, that United became unavoidably attractive to the kind of people who tend to fasten on to such success stories like vampiric super-capitalist incubi. Buoyed in those early years by their own global presence, United are now being leeched by agents of precisely this system. They have simply been unlucky, attracting not the&nbsp;usual gallery of cash-splurging egomaniacs, but the only sensible billionaires in the business.</p><p>It is process with an endpoint too. There is a theory that the appointment of Moyes is in one sense a holding manoeuvre, a manager of limited experience inserted as a useful idiot to keep the machine rolling along with as little chafing as possible while the asset is sweated to its limits. And yet even as&nbsp;United are being so resourcefully milked, the brand itself will begin to wither beneath their feet. In the past, United managers who failed to win league titles – Ron Atkinson, Tommy Docherty – still looked like United managers, promoting an elegantly freewheeling brand of football, failing with grandeur, failing like United. But modern football simply doesn't allow you to play like this. It is a crowded sport, a possession game, where the team that wins is also the team that gets to play and pass and starve the opposition into invisibility.</p><p>Brands, as opposed to fanbases, are fickle things. How many Chinese teenagers, how many of United's alleged 569 million &quot;followers&quot; will continue to find themselves hooked on Moyes's roundheads, a team engaged at the top level in a continual rearguard against better resourced, more coherent opponents? United's hierarchy is, of course, aware of the need to compete and money has been splurged on players in the last few months. It feels like part of a keenly-managed balancing act. There is a suggestion that the Glazers may sell the club in 2017 when the current loan arrangements run out, although potential buyers will have to find at least &pound;2bn, and will inherit a club still saddled with &pound;500m of ownership debts. There has been talk of more direct action, of organised resistance to the progressive siphoning off of match-day income, of a cartel of well-intentioned fan-financiers making the Glazers an offer they can't refuse. Most appealing has been the suggestion of a kind of ex-player cavalry charge, with Beckham, Scholes and Gary Neville forming their own billionaire-backed group to storm the gates and take back the keep. For now, United will remain an object of precarious fascination, a great British sporting institution not so much in crisis as in the grip of a wider gravity, and hostage to a very modern kind of sporting trial.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/434031729|2014-05-04T13:20:47Z|6c8f2040bb365a1e44e05c3dfefed967855c431b -->",

        "headline":"Manchester United's Wayne Rooney a doubt for Bayern Munich trip",
        "body":"<p>David Moyes is waiting anxiously on Wayne Rooney's fitness for Manchester United's Champions League quarter-final second leg against Bayern Munich. Rooney is \"touch and go\" and is awaiting a scan to discover if a toe injury is simply heavy bruising or is as serious as a hairline fracture.</p><p>Rooney is definitely out of Saturday's trip to Newcastle United. Moyes is already without Robin van Persie and Rooney's absence for Wednesday evening's return with Bayern at the Allianz Arena would be a sizeable blow. The tie is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/01/manchester-united-bayern-munich-champions-league-match-report\" title=\"\">poised at 1-1</a>.</p><p>Moyes said: \"Wayne is injured. He has a badly bruised toe so he won't be involved [against Newcastle]. It will be touch and go for Wayne for Wednesday. With a lot of toe injuries you have to make sure there isn't a hairline fracture or crack in your toe. We will have all that checked.</p><p>\"It is a toe injury and they are never easy when you get one. You could see him limping in the game towards the end quite badly. There is not an awful lot you can do with a toe injury – sometimes you can feel better quite quickly with them and sometimes you need an injection possibly to play with it if it is bruising.\"</p><p>Moyes has suffered ill luck regarding injuries throughout his first season in charge. Yet he refused to complain. \"It's football. You look at what Wayne has done for us in the last league games for instance,\" he said. \"Against Aston Villa he scored two goals. There was a couple at West Ham including that special goal.\"</p><p>Moyes can turn to Danny Welbeck, who with 10 goals is set to beat his best of 12 in the 2011-12 season, and Javier Hernández. \"Danny has come in and done really well,\" Moyes said. \"He played well in midweek. We also want to try to get some minutes for Chicharito as well.\"</p><p>Welbeck had a golden chance to score for United during the first half against Bayern when he ran clear at Manuel Neuer before chipping the ball straight at the goalkeeper.</p><p>Moyes said: \"I was more annoyed about Danny's miss in that I thought: 'What an opportunity.' I thought: 'Go on and slot it in.' I actually thought the goalkeeper gave him a little bit to the side. I was more disappointed that he didn't take because it was a big chance in a game like that.</p><p>\"Forwards do that. If he had passed it and the keeper had saved it you might have thought: 'Why did you not chip it, Danny, or tried something else?'\"</p><p>Ryan Giggs is also a doubt for the trip to Munich owing to a minor injury. While Moyes is still deciding whether to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/01/ryan-giggs-david-moyes-new-contract-stall\" title=\"\">offer the Welshman a new playing contract</a> the manager is clear the 40-year-old will continue as a coach next season. \"He's very much a part of our staff,\" he said.</p><p>\"He's got an injury which means I'm probably going to leave him behind [for Newcastle] to see if I can get him recovered this weekend, because I need him to try to get back fit for Wednesday night.</p><p>\" But Ryan is very much a part of the staff. We brought him in at the start and he's been a great help since we've been here.\"</p><p>While Jonny Evans and Chris Smalling are back in training following their respective calf and hamstring problems they remain a doubt for Newcastle. Rafael da Silva is doubtful with a thigh strain. \"Jonny Evans and Chris Smalling are doing better. They have got a chance for [Saturday]. I will see how they go. I might include them in the squad. They are not just quite up to the training levels at the moment,\" Moyes said.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/433779135|2014-05-04T13:20:47Z|9a9ecfa30ccf45b67f8f1b23b0abf93dc83748ec -->",

        "body":"<p>There's a terrific scene in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2013/nov/20/manchester-united-class-of-92-documentary\">Class Of 92</a>, the documentary about Manchester United's FA Youth Cup winning side of that year, when its six most famous players, Ryan Giggs, David Beckham, Paul Scholes, Nicky Butt and Gary and Phil Neville, are sitting in a restaurant reminiscing about the ways in which Alex Ferguson would tell them they'd been dropped from the team.</p><p>&quot;He came up to me once and said, 'son, you're not playing today, but don't worry about that, there's a game in two weeks that I need you for',&quot; said Gary Neville. &quot;I thought, 'hang on there's three matches before then...' I couldn't work out whether I'd been dropped or whether he thought I was so important, I had to be saved...&quot;</p><p>&quot;He told me it was too hot once...&quot; said Scholes.</p><p>&quot;He said to me the pitch was too nice,&quot; recalled Butt. &quot;He said, 'November's when I'll need you son, when the ground's heavy...'&quot;</p><p>&quot;I never used to answer my door if we were in the hotel,&quot; said Giggs.</p><p>&quot;Yeah, you used to hear that little cough in the corridor, and you knew it was him,&quot; said Gary Neville.</p><p>&quot;He wouldn't come if you were playing,&quot; continued Giggs, &quot;but I used to think, 'if he can't find me, he can't drop me...'&quot;</p><p>It was all said with affection, and left you thinking that they would still run through walls for Ferguson if he asked them too.</p><p>When he reflected on what made him such a successful manager, Ferguson said that the most important element was control. As soon as he felt a player was threatening that control he was dispensed with ruthlessly.</p><p>While direct comparisons between football and cricket are specious, it seemed obvious that England's most successful coaches of recent years, Duncan Fletcher and Andy Flower, each had a measure of that control – at least until their eras descended into horribly similar kinds of entropy.</p><p>Ferguson's notion of control was partly psychological. Being aggressive and dictatorial was only a temporary fix. His real authority came from the ongoing success of his methods, which he was clever enough to adapt to changing circumstance. Often - as with the cough in the corridor - his presence was enough.</p><p>Similarly, Duncan Fletcher's legend was neatly coined by the title of his book, Behind The Shades. He understood the value of silence, of being enigmatic. Many England players tell of the strange sensation that would overcome them when they felt his presence behind the net in which they were batting.</p><p>Fletcher would say very little to his players, thus everything he did say (and a lot of what he left out) became imbued with significance. His technical knowledge was crucial: his charges realised that he understood deeply what he was talking about. Like Ferguson, he was ruthless in his judgment. He built close relationships with his captains, Nasser Hussain and Michael Vaughan, and kept the rest guessing.</p><p>Andy Flower's control came from a different place. His record as a player was better than any of the team, and the strength of character he had exhibited in essentially exiling himself by protesting against Robert Mugabe spoke of unimpeachable integrity. Like Fletcher he appeared introverted and steely. In aligning himself with a new kind of technical analysis, he moved the English game forwards. He knew more than the men he coached.</p><p>As Ferguson had asserted, once control was gone, so, soon afterwards, was the coach. In part this was simply the natural cycle of events. External forces are often uncontrollable. Yet both Fletcher and Flower brought England momentous and joyous successes that have broadened the horizons of the game here. </p><p>In his later years, Ferguson sensed that the amount of money in football had made the players too powerful to control with explosions of anger and the use of authority, and while Fletcher retains much of his enigma as he coaches India, his presence feels different and lighter there.</p><p>Now that England have been eliminated in Bangladesh, the next major event is the appointment of a new coach. If the unsubstantiated story that <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/cricket/kevin-pietersen-reason-gary-kirsten-3285364\">Gary Kirsten has turned down the job</a> because he was unable to select Kevin Pietersen is correct, then control is already an issue. </p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/mar/30/ashley-giles-england-world-t20\">Ashley Giles is among the favourites</a>, and the idea of a coalition with Graham Thorpe and Paul Collingwood carries much of the same appeal of the rumoured takeover of Manchester United fronted by the Class Of 92. But they lack the natural advantages that Fletcher and Flower had in asserting control, mostly because of their familiarity. In an age of uncertainty, that could be key. </p><p><strong>• <a href=\"http://theoldbatsman.blogspot.co.uk/\">This blog first appeared on The Old Batsman</a><br />• <a href=\"https://twitter.com/theoldbatsman\">Follow The Old Batsman on Twitter</a><br />• <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/guardiansport\">Follow Guardian Sport on Facebook</a></strong></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/433588072|2014-05-04T13:20:47Z|abacf68dd29222153d8d973baf49dda246971f1e -->",

        "headline":"Breaking the Law: why football set-pieces need urgent reform",
        "body":"<p>OK, this is not exactly a pressing issue. If, that is, codified injustice in the world's most popular sport is the sort of thing you can take in your stride. Football's existing set-piece laws are riven with wrongness and, as if that is not intolerable enough, the garbled logic underpinning the laws detracts from the spectacle.</p><p></p><p>There are many flaws and fallacies in the rules governing set-pieces. For instance, they indulge incompetence. If you boot the ball into your own net from a free-kick, no goal is awarded. The opposition just get a corner. Why so lenient on ineptitude? If blameless defenders are given no reprieve when a shot deflects off them into the net, why should someone gawky enough to score an own goal from a free-kick be pardoned? Similarly, why is a penalty not awarded when a goalkeeper picks up a backpass? The ban on handling backpasses was introduced 22 years ago but apparently law-makers believe goalkeepers still belong in some evolutionary remand wing because their brains need several generations to adapt, so an indirect free-kick will suffice. That, of course, is just a further manifestation of the institutionalised bias towards the most mollycoddled players on the pitch (goalkeepers, for reasons still unexplained, being the only ones who have an inalienable right to spend up to six seconds of personal quality time with the ball, during which every other player on the pitch is reduced to the role of pathetic onlooker, like forced flagwavers at a royal wedding).</p><p></p><p>But the worst thing about the set-piece laws is that they do precisely the opposite of what they are supposed to do: they persecute the victim. Free-kicks are far from free. They come at the cost of one player. When a team is awarded a free-kick due to the villainy of the opposition – or a corner or throw-in after the opposition has whacked the ball out of play in a legal but often craven act – then the game resumes with the attacking team effectively a man down. At a corner kick, say, the attacking team can only have a maximum of nine outfield players in the box while the defending team can have 10. Of course, the missing player – the one taking the set-piece – has the ball but he is compelled to surrender it immediately. He is thus partially emasculated. Injustice heaped on injustice.</p><p></p><p>Sometimes canny teams have found ways around this. One famous example came in the Manchester United-Chelsea match at Old Trafford in January 2009, when at a United cornerWayne Rooney rolled the ball out of the quadrant and then wandered off as if the corner had not been taken, whereupon his accomplice, Ryan Giggs, sauntered over and took possession, dribbled closer to the box and crossed for Cristiano Ronaldo to head into the net. The wheeze outwitted Chelsea's defenders but also, alas, the officials, who disallowed the goal. At least Swiss officials had been more alert two years previously, when <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nBoKNy7j0Y\" title=\"\">Mladen Petric and Ivan Rakitic pulled the same stunt to score for Basel against Grasshoppers</a>. But the rarity of such cases shows how important it is to give the advantage back to the righteous.</p><p></p><p>There is an obvious way to do this: allow players to pass to themselves from set-pieces. This would entitle players to embark on dribbles straight from corners or free-kicks, meaning they no longer have to deliver the ball far away or summon a team-mate to come for a short pass. By permitting a player to exploit all the benefits of having the ball – rather than forcing him to cough it up straight away – the interests of justice and entertainment are properly served.</p><p></p><p>Field hockey introduced self-pass set-pieces in 2012. The main reason for doing it in that sport was to reduce stoppages and make the game more fluid. Football would reap that fruit, too, and, boy, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/may/19/football.time\" title=\"\">does it need it</a>. If a fouled player were allowed to take free-kicks himself, liberated from the obligation to await back-up, he even may be able to recover and overcome the crime. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer might not have looked so smug in 1998 if Rob Lee had been permitted to get straight back up and take the scoring chance robbed by the dastardly Norwegian. Of course, that infamous abuse of a loophole is also a reason <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2011/apr/20/why-penalty-laws-should-change\" title=\"\">why the penalty law must be altered</a>.</p><p></p><p>So we are agreed. The current set-piece laws protect fools and knaves. They must be changed. The time for action is, oh, whenever.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/433562482|2014-05-04T13:20:47Z|6120cc8a39c8c87b24b2cedfe9940465bd63bef4 -->",

Who needs a midfield anyway? In fact who needs the ball at all? For 66 minutes at Old Trafford it looked as though David Moyes might have mustered one of the more defiantly retro tactical triumphs of recent years. On a night that began slowly but built to a second-half barrage of rolling noise, Manchester United produced an intriguingly  old-school performance of condensed, fast-breaking, midfield-bypassing football, the kind of football that might have come served up drizzled with horseradish and spritzed with gravy and labelled modern British with a twist.</p><p>Bayern remain favourites in this tie after Bastian Schweinsteiger's equaliser cancelled out United's opening goal, a sublime, twisting header from by Nemanja Vidic from a corner. Plus there will be those who dismiss this as familiar narrow-horizon tactical territory for Moyes, an Everton rehash on the big stage as his straight-lines team, complete with obdurate Belgian ball-shield, spoiled against opponents with more interest in passing the ball. Bayern were effectively spiked for long periods in a tight but oddly lopsided match, a meeting of pass-and-move and hit-and-run that leaves United with some hope in Bavaria.</p><p>As Bayern kicked off on a lovely clear crisp Manchester evening and immediately set about shuttling the ball among themselves it was already clear how this match was likely to go. United adopted a kind of guerilla-football approach, giving the opposition what they are geared up to take – territory, possession – in order to strike from behind the lines of a staged retreat.</p><p>This tie was always likely to hinge on how exactly United chose to counter Bayern's overwhelming, almost obsessional strength in midfield in the Jupp-Pep era, a process that has only accelerated under a manager who famously announced \"I love midfielders\" and whose teams are testament to this, one of football's great, if rather schmaltzy, modern love affairs.</p><p>Guardiola will never cede the ground here. He is the master of one-upmanship: you pick five in midfield, he'll pick six. This is a man whose midfields have midfields: midfields within midfields, lines between the lines.</p><p>This was the challenge Bayern posed at Old Trafford, a team so well-drilled in their passing and compressing of the game into one central swathe that at times playing them must feel a bit like being jostled to death on a tennis court by at least 20 scurrying, little, short-passing midfield generals.</p><p>It is exactly the kind of high-stakes tactical riddle many had expected Moyes to falter over. But he had a plan. And it worked. For a while, at least, before its basic limitations – mainly the almost complete concession of the ball in the first 70 minutes – began to nag at the edges. Guardiola picked seven midfielders in all, one of them, Javi Martínez, in defence, another a converted full-back.</p><p>Moyes replied by allowing his condensed midfield-five simply to back off. With Wayne Rooney the extra man when Bayern had the ball (unless stated otherwise, Bayern always had the ball) this left Danny Welbeck a lone but significant central striker in what was for a while a fancified game of kick-and-rush.</p><p>It is a tactic that has sometimes worked against Guardiola teams, the condensed swarming midfield treated not as a strength but a weakness, a high defensive line offering space beyond. Here Ryan Giggs played his first diagonal pass over the top for Welbeck in the opening minute, and Welbeck even had the ball in the net moments later but the goal was disallowed – a little limply; this is a gymnastic, contact sport – for a high boot in the buildup.</p><p>Steadily the Bayern midfield began to thrum through the high gears as Philipp Lahm, Schweinsteiger and Toni Kroos shuttled the ball between them with the usual upright muscular deftness, but Moyes' tactics of deep resistance and pace on the break created a kind of managed stasis. At times, as Bayern took 80% possession of the ball in the opening quarter of the match, this all seemed at times a little too cowed and dutiful for the club of footballing dreams.</p><p>It worked well enough. United began to strike from behind their guard, their earliest concerted attacks coming when Marouane Fellaini stationed himself briefly in that Everton-style bruiser-trequartista position, shielding and nudging and holding up the ball while Jérôme Boateng flailed at his back. At the same time Bayern's condensing of the play looked bizarrely high-risk as Welbeck had the beating of both central defenders for speed. With half-time approaching United had the clearest chance, Welbeck running on to Rooney's through pass but finding Manuel Neuer equal to his attempted dink. There is a time to dink. This was not it.</p><p>Five minutes after half-time, midfield still swamped, abandoned, given up to the surging tides, United took the lead. Rooney's left-wing corner found Vidic seeming to levitate above the Bayern defence in order to plant a genuinely thrilling set-piece header into the far corner. The lead lasted just eight minutes as Bayern's possession finally paid off with a lovely goal created via another moment of old-school aerial ball, Mario Mandzukic heading down for Schweinsteiger to finish beautifully. Advantage Bayern, but Moyes will take a little retro acclaim, and even some confidence, as United began to discover some midfield control of their own in the dying minutes.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/433524463|2014-05-04T13:20:47Z|11c8a4472d43d0866165f84908413acd8981131d -->",

In the end, United actually played a hybrid of the two systems, and Welbeck's positioning was the key to this tactical battle.</p><p>At kick-off Welbeck lined up in a wide position, but throughout the first 10 minutes – Bayern's weak period, judging by their sloppy starts against both Arsenal and United – he played up front, spearheading United's attack and harrying the Bayern centre-backs.</p><p>Welbeck soon had the ball in the net after some clever skill towards the opposite side of the pitch – the 'goal' was harshly disallowed for a high boot – and in that centre-right channel, he continued to cause Bayern  problems.</p><p>There were three further incidents of Welbeck's pace in behind the Bayern defence providing a real threat. After 27 minutes he chased an over-hit long ball and was briefly pulled back by the Bayern centre-back Javi Martínez on the edge of the box. Welbeck made little of the incident, but Martínez was fortunate not to be penalised.</p><p>Then there was Welbeck's miss when put through on goal by Wayne Rooney for a one-on-one with Manuel Neuer – as clear a chance as United could possibly wish for. Welbeck's tame chip underlined his only major weakness, his finishing.</p><p>Finally, there was David de Gea's long goalkick downfield which an isolated Welbeck battled for, as Neuer darted out of his goal to sweep up – Welbeck was adjudged to have fouled Rafinha, again rather harshly. Bayern couldn't cope with his sheer speed.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-433562176'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/4/2/1396398081292/Man-Utd-v-Bayern-Munich-001.jpg' alt='Man Utd v Bayern Munich' width='460' height='532' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Danny Welbeck started up front and was a constant threat but United suffered down their left flank, where Rafinha was allowed space and eventually crossed for Bastian Schweinsteiger to score the equaliser for Bayern Munich. Illustration: Graphic</figcaption></figure><p>The downside, however, was that when Welbeck was up front he wasn't on the left – and this meant the Bayern right-back Rafinha had acres of space to exploit. United's midfield shape was lopsided – Antonio Valencia was a pure right-winger but Ryan Giggs more of a left-sided central midfielder, and at 40 the Welshman doesn't possess the stamina to get out to the touchline and shut down Rafinha.</p><p>This might have been a deliberate ploy from United, however. In a hugely talented XI, Rafinha is arguably the only player who is not genuinely top-class – he's a fine footballer, but less threatening than any of Bayern's other attacking options. Perhaps Moyes was happy to allow him freedom.</p><p>Either way, Bayern continually hit huge diagonal balls out to Rafinha, who was galloping forward in typical  Brazilian full-back fashion. He didn't have an obvious target for crosses, though; he continually looked up, saw only Thomas Müller in the box and decided to play short passes, often to Arjen Robben in an inside-right position, with the Dutchman shooting repeatedly with his left foot.</p><p>Nemanja Vidic's equaliser forced Pep Guardiola into action – he immediately summoned Mario Mandzukic, a classic No9. Perhaps, having gone ahead, United should have switched to the more defensive shape with Welbeck in a permanent left-sided position, to prevent Bayern advancing so easily. Instead, Welbeck remained up front, so Rafinha still had space, and more crucially he now had a target in the box,&nbsp;too.</p><p>Sure enough, a fine cross brought the equaliser: Rafinha received the ball in space and crossed for Mandzukic, who headed down for Bastian Schweinsteiger's excellent finish.United were fully aware of Bayern's threat by this point, but it appeared a calculated gamble to leave that wing open. Perhaps Welbeck should have moved left immediately after United went ahead.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/433537416|2014-05-04T13:20:47Z|ef2c41eb70200d7620cb1e93e95e76e472388a6b -->",

They had given everything, against superior opponents, and for eight minutes they led and Old Trafford, once again, felt like a happy place.</p><p>Moyes will just wish his players could have done a better job of protecting their lead before Bayern Munich finally bared their teeth. Instead, Bastian Schweinsteiger's equaliser leaves the European champions in a position of strength going into the return leg. Yet not, perhaps, the position many people might have anticipated bearing in mind the ordeals United have suffered on this ground.</p><p>The ruthless winning machine from Bavaria certainly did not get everything their own way. Schweinsteiger will be suspended next week after his challenge on Wayne Rooney late-on brought him a second yellow card of the night, and a booking for Javi Martínez also makes him ineligible. Moyes was entitled to wonder whether it might have been a more profitable occasion considering the chance Danny Welbeck passed up in the first half, and at least Nemanja Vidic's goal means United will head to Germany in a reasonable frame of mind. Their fans will travel in hope rather than expectation. Yet that is still a better position than many had presumed.</p><p>Bayern have now scored in 61 successive games but this was the first time in 18 matches outside Munich when they have not won, and only the second occasion out of 25 when they have not managed at least two goals. United had to chase and harry and, for long spells, just try to hang in there. They spent a large part of the night defending on the edge of their own penalty area and Moyes was right to enthuse about his players' efforts. Too many times this season his team have lacked togetherness and direction. This time, they played as though affronted by the suggestion it would be a walkover for the continent's reigning champions.</p><p>That was the only way United were going to get through the night. Bayern attacked from every angle. On one side  Arjen Robben teased and tormented Alexander Büttner. On the other Franck Ribéry was quick, elusive and relentless. Bayern's problem was getting through the middle, starting the night without an orthodox centre-forward. But for the most part they simply kept the ball, looking for spaces to exploit, pinning their opponents back.</p><p>United did not have the same refinement. They did, however, play with structure and organisation. They set about frustrating their opponents, operating on the counter-attack, and the ploys of conservatism made it difficult for their opponents. Vidic reminded Old Trafford why he will be sorely missed next season. Rio Ferdinand rose to the challenge and, though it was never easy for them, Büttner and Phil Jones stuck to the task of trying to subdue Robben and Ribéry. Büttner eventually went off with a hamstring strain, meaning Jones moved to left-back, with Antonio Valencia dropping into the right-back slot. Yet United's patched-up defence held out.</p><p>They can also be encouraged by what they saw of Bayern's back four. Welbeck's acceleration gave him the beating of Jérôme Boateng on more than one occasion. It is just a pity for United he could not have been more ruthless with that chance, five minutes before half-time, when Boateng slipped and left the forward running clear.</p><p>What followed might ultimately be a key moment in this tie. Welbeck never looked fully confident and Manuel Neuer is too accomplished to try to deceive him with a little dinked effort. This was not an occasion to be cute and the goalkeeper kept to his feet and read Welbeck's intentions.</p><p>The rollicking Wayne Rooney meted out to his team-mate will linger in the memory. Yet Welbeck, more than anyone, showed Bayern are not entirely comfortable when players are running at them. United could also reflect on that moment, only three minutes in, when he did beat Neuer only for his volley to be ruled out because of a high foot as he set himself up. The counter-argument was that Martínez had ducked into the challenge, though it should also be noted Bayern's defenders had stopped in the split-second before Welbeck let fly.</p><p>Bayern's strength was in midfield – the wonderful blend of control and power that Schweinsteiger, Toni Kroos and Philipp Lahm provide – and Moyes was fully justified in removing Ryan Giggs at half-time. Giggs had been majestic in the last round against Olympiakos. Now he looked what he was: a 40-year-old among younger men.</p><p>Marouane Fellaini struggled again to impress but at least he was a penalty-box distraction for the United goal. Rooney swung over a corner from the left and Lahm had let Vidic go. Why Bayern's smallest player was assigned to the United captain was a mystery in the first place. Vidic leant back, twisted his neck and the ball found the bottom corner of Neuer's net.</p><p>Guardiola responded by bringing on Mario Mandzukic for Thomas Müller and the Croatian was instrumental in the equaliser, heading Rafinha's right-wing delivery into Schweinsteiger's path. It was an elegant swish of his left boot to send the ball into the roof of the net.</p><p>Schweinsteiger's night ended sourly, with him accusing Rooney of diving, but Bayern still emerged in a position of command, like they almost always do.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/433524299|2014-05-04T13:20:47Z|84a2ac804be1676de7ae77280b99f272a97f310e -->",

They're at home and have the away goal, so United will require a victory - or a score draw that is better than 1-1 to avoid penalties. It is a daunting task. But United will be heartened by their performance tonight. They were thoroughly outplayed for long periods, but refused to wilt in the face of incessant Bayern pressure, made one of the game's best chances (missed by Danny Welbeck) and showed there is life in them yet by holding on for a draw that keeps the tie alive. What's more, Bastian Schweinsteiger and Javi Martinez are suspended for the second leg. Maybe David Moyes is The Chosen One. Imagine if he pulls this one off. Thanks for reading.

This says a lot about the pressure on Moyes at home this season but also makes me wonder if maybe Utd are not quite as dismal as their overall record suggests.

The pressure's off in the league, they're embarking on an exciting new period with a new manager and they're in the quarter-final of the Champions League. Four more matches – four measly little matches – and they could be in the final, the chance to win Europe's most prestigious competition for the fourth time within their grasp. All they've got to do first is beat Bayern Munich and sure, it'll be tough against the all-conquering side that wrapped up the Bundesliga title before the clocks went forward, but United are coming into this bang in form, a 4-1 thumping of Aston Villa on the weekend the perfect way for them to warm up for this tie. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DftNqjk4VCc\">Whodaman? David Moyes is a man!</a> What a terrific time to be alive. Bayern won't know what's hit 'em but let me tell you something: David Moyes's Manchester United are about to hit 'em and they're gonna hit 'em good, right in the kisser if performances this season are anything to go by. </p><p>And now we've got all that out the way, it's time to return to reality, where the situation is rather more bleak for United. Indeed tonight might be the last time they see Champions League football at Old Trafford for a while. United aren't going to be qualifying for next season's competition via the league, that much is clear, and it is going to take the kind of stubbornness, togetherness and outrageous fortune that served Chelsea so well in 2012 for them to win it this year. If Moyes suddenly manages to strike a balance between defence and tactic, if David de Gea can be cloned, if Marouane Fellaini separates his arse from his elbow, if Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic are hypnotised into thinking it's 2008 and Wayne Rooney is told it's it's 2004, then maybe United can make a good fist of this. But the smart money is on this tie being over after the first leg. Bayern, the European champions, are surely too good for this not to be yet another ordeal for United in this season of ordeals. </p> <p>In fairness, United have been putting on a brave face during the build-up. It's mostly for the sake of appearances, but still. Ryan Giggs, displaying the utter abhorrence of mediocrity that Moyes could do with developing sharpish, has given off the impression that he does not know the meaning of the word underdog. Fear is there to be embraced, used to your advantage and turned into positive energy.</p><p>Meanwhile Arjen Robben, Bayern's brilliant Dutchman and the scorer of the goal that won them the trophy last year, has urged caution. United still command respect, despite it all, and the danger of writing them off is that in the back of your mind, the fear's still there, waiting to come out, waiting to make us all look stupid. This is Manchester United we're talking about and that still counts for something. The muscle memory is still there. It has to count for something. </p><p>Or does it? The evidence of this season suggests otherwise. Other than when they beat Arsenal at Old Trafford, United have been embarrassed by every proper side they have faced. Liverpool won 3-0 at Old Trafford and so did City last week. The defeat to City was particularly chastening. All that talk in the build-up that United may be getting back to business after beating Olympiakos was turned to dust inside 43 seconds. It was like watching Manny Pacquiao versus Ricky Hatton in 2009; one punch to their glass jaw and United were out cold. It was just so easy for both City and Liverpool and with that in mind, what will this formidable Bayern side, with their brand of tik-und-takenberg, do to them? United are 6-1 to win tonight. They have never had longer odds to win at home. Their fans, those of them not gadding about ordering ridiculous fly-by banners, are dreading this, fully prepared to watch the full 90-minute torture through their fingers. United have never lost a European tie at home by more than one goal but, in honour of that balmy night in Barcelona, it is always tempting to Bayern to win this 1999-0.</p><p>In a strange way, that gallows humour could work to United's advantage. There have been signs of a siege mentality developing at Old Trafford in recent weeks and there is almost the feeling of an FA Cup third-round tie to this match, United the unlikely but plucky underdogs who must scrap, fight and JUST GET IN BAYERN'S FACE BECAUSE THESE FAHKIN' FORRINERS WON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO THEN. For one night only, Manchester on a Tuesday night must become Stoke on a Tuesday night. Does Moyes know any good rain dances? It's the least you'd expect from The Chosen One. </p><p><b>Kick-off:</b> 7.45pm.<br /></p> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-04-01T18:20:13.246+01:00\">at 6.20pm BST</time></p> </div><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/433476082|2014-05-04T13:20:47Z|b959b1af98287c8d003cb01ff70639c2455d2a5d -->",

        "headline":"Bayern Munich are coming and they're bringing Das Big Slipper",
        "body":"<h2>WDLWWLWLDWDWWWWDWDWDLLWWW WWWLLLWLWWLDDWDWLWWLW</h2><p></p><p>When a sliver of Manchester United fans hired a plane to drag a message through the sky in seven-foot letters on Saturday, they perpetrated the most contemptibly ostentatious display of discontent since Liam Ridgewell published pictures of himself wiping his backside with £20 notes. Aptly, Ridgewell has been dwelling around the bottom ever since; United, meanwhile, could be about to suffer a spanking that will leave even their least attention-seeking fans pleading for relief. Because Bayern Munich are heading to Old Trafford and they're bringing Das Big Slipper. Cover your eyes, kids.</p><p></p><p>David Moyes' maiden season as United's flaming scarecrow has been awful, but not so awful that its awfulness cannot be exaggerated. And not only by fans: assorted media outlets have been so quick to denounce the record-breaking misery at United that they have denounced nadirs that aren't really nadirs at all (\"the joint-worst away defeat to Manchester City since 1989\" is surely a lunge of Rafael-like clumsiness). Interestingly, the attitude of some fans and media contrasts with that of rivals such as Liverpool and Manchester City, who in recent weeks have given the impression that they didn't want to beat United too badly lest Moyes be jilted. But here come Bayern, with Das Big Slipper.</p><p></p><p>\"Personally, I really want to win at Old Trafford,\" stormed Bastian Schweinsteiger in a statement of the obvious into which the Fiver chooses to read great menace. Schweinsteiger then made passing mention of the 1999 Big Cup final, which the English media have been banging on about relentlessly in the build-up to tonight's clash, though in their eagerness to highlight the disparity between the gloriousness of Lord Ferg and the haplessness of Moyes, few have pointed out that Bayern already avenged that defeat twice during the reign of Lord Ferg – including just four years ago when they recovered from 3-0 down in the second leg to knock United out. And that was before Bayern had Das Big Slipper. All of which suggests that, um, much as the Fiver would like to introduce a little balance into discussions about Moyes, the imbalance in quality between United and Bayern means this would be a dumb time to do it. United have never lost a home European tie by more than one goal and if that doesn't change tonight, they'll be tearing down the Lod Ferg statue and replacing it with one of David de Gea.</p><p></p><p>\"We are not taking this lightly,\" interjected Pep Guardiola, who showed his determination to steer the narrative to the other extreme by adding: \"United have been in thousands, even millions, of finals, so they know what to do.\" Wear extra padding in their shorts?</p><p></p><h2>LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE TONIGHT</h2><p></p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football\" title=\"\">Join Jacob Steinberg from 7.30pm for MBM coverage of Manchester United 1-4 Bayern Munich, while John Ashdown will be on hand for Barcelona 2-1 Atlético Madrid</a>.</p><p></p><h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2><p></p><p>\"Some in the English press want that. But it's not the English press that decides … For the British press, whatever we do is never enough.

Presumably the FA was worried that, on this season's evidence, Fellaini being told to sit on the naughty step would involve him shambling towards the step with all the speed and grace of a pub team striker after a heavy night, getting there late, swinging an angry foot at it, then driving his arm forcibly into the banister before throwing his arms wide and affecting a look of outraged innocence as the staircase collapses round his ears\" – Jason Tew.</p><p></p><p>\"Judging from Nike's publicity photo for England's new kit (yesterday's Fiver), it seems that by focusing on the benefits of 'dual-knit fabrication that incorporates cotton and recycled polyester for superior sweat-wicking properties' and the inclusion of 'white satin tape on the shoulders and a new metallic weave in the crest to give the shirt a distinctive shine inspired by the armour worn by St George', they have not paid attention to the basics. Surely their fabric should not make poor Jack Wilshere's right bicep itch so bad that this is the best shot they could come up with. Or maybe he just got a new tat?\" – Gareth Rogers.</p><p></p><p>\"Looking at Wayne Rooney in that picture, does the 'dual-knit fabrication' also offer protection <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsD6AL3HJtM\" title=\"\">from this</a> [warning – Fiver Alien Spoiler Ed]?\" – Chris Peac0ck.</p><p></p><p>• Send your letters to <a href=\"mailto:the.boss@theguardian.com\" title=\"\">the.boss@theguardian.com</a>.

        "body":"<p>David Moyes is considering calling time on Ryan Giggs' glittering Manchester United playing career. The manager may wait until the end of the season before deciding whether to offer a new one-year deal to the 40-year-old, although it is understood there is no guarantee Moyes will do so.</p><p>By this stage of the campaign, Giggs has usually signed fresh 12-month terms. Last year the Welshman agreed a new deal on 1 March but with just six matches of the Premier League season to play, Moyes is still deciding whether to offer him fresh terms.</p><p>While Giggs said on Monday that he is still enjoying playing but wanted to see how he felt at the close of the campaign, Moyes also wants to assess his options. The Scot is targeting a major overhaul of this squad this summer with midfield an area he particularly wants to strengthen.</p><p>Moyes has used Giggs, who is now player-coach, even more sparingly than his predecessor, Sir Alex Ferguson, during his first year in charge. Giggs has made only 13 starts, with his first for two months coming in the 3-0 Champions League win over Olympiakos at Old Trafford a fortnight ago.</p><p>In his role as coach Giggs has become peripheral during training sessions and, ahead of Tuesday evening's Champions League quarter-final first leg against Bayern Munich at Old Trafford, he was forced to deny a rift with Moyes, while sitting next to the Scot at the press conference.</p><p>\"There is no problem with the manager. I don't know where that came from,\" said Giggs. \"The relationship is good. Of course as a player you want to play all the time. I know over the last five or six years you are not going to play every game. I normally play every two or three weeks to get the best out of me. The last game was probably my first for seven weeks but you are not sulking, you just have to be ready to play your best for the team.\"</p><p>Giggs has made a record 961 appearances for United in an outstanding 23-year professional career in which he has won 13 Premier League titles, two European Cups, four FA Cups and four League Cups. He was also voted the Professional Football Association Players' Player of the Year for 2008-9.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/433478071|2014-05-04T13:20:47Z|aa603cd4887faeef1e43217e41f36dafe5028ccb -->",

        "headline":"Bayern Munich present David Moyes with biggest test at Manchester United",
        "body":"<p>Alexander Buttner, Manchester United's reserve left-back, could be found on the training pitches inflicting on Shinji Kagawa the kind of public ordeal no professional footballer ever wants to suffer: commonly known as the nutmeg. Buttner certainly enjoyed his victory, with the television cameras rolling and an audience of the world's media, but there was still the clinging suspicion that this might be as good as it gets for the man assigned to Arjen Robben on Tuesday night.</p><p>Buttner versus Robben certainly has a look of mismatch about it, in keeping with the public perception about United's quarter-final against Bayern Munich. Patrice Evra is suspended while Rafael da Silva's thigh injury means Phil Jones will probably have the unenviable task of clinging to Franck Ribéry's coat-tails. Chris Smalling has not played since 8 March and, once again, David Moyes is having to piece together a new-look defence. All this, remember, against a side who have already wrapped up the Bundesliga in record time and amassed a goal difference of plus 146, and rising, over the last two seasons.</p><p>It is  difficult to remember the last time United hosted a game of this magnitude with so little expectation outside their own circles of winning. Yet this has been a strange season at Old Trafford in any manner of ways. The latest press conference was most notable for its awkwardness when the Fox TV correspondent asked Ryan Giggs, sitting directly beside Moyes, if his intention was eventually to become the new manager, leading to a hasty interception from the club's press officer. A television crew from Germany could be found seeking out English reporters to debate Moyes' problems. \"Will Bayern score seven, eight or nine?\" was the opening question.</p><p>All of this tends to overlook the fact that Old Trafford, on the cherished European nights, is still a place that can inspire its team. Robben, for one, appears to realise the dangers of overconfidence. \"The media and public opinion is that Manchester are not in good shape and that we're going through to the semis,\" he said. \"But I don't like that at all.\" Bayern, of course, are not often accused of complacency or underestimating opponents. If they were, they would not have eased to another German title before the changing of the clocks.</p><p>Instead, it is going to be a night when Moyes has to demonstrate that his tactical knowledge at the highest level is more accomplished than has been evident at other times this season. He predicted a \"little bit of caution\" and, though United supporters do not traditionally like statements of that nature, the opposite would be reckless considering the importance of maintaining a realistic chance of progressing against the champions in the Allianz Arena next week. For now it should be about keeping the second leg alive in a way that has largely been beyond Arsenal in the last two seasons.</p><p>That, however, could easily be beyond the Premier League's seventh-placed team when Bayern's riches are such that a footballer of Thomas Müller's distinction may still not make Pep Guardiola's starting XI. Müller will probably be on the bench even though Thiago Alcântara, the player Moyes decided against signing last summer, is injured. At other times Javi Martínez and Toni Kroos have not made the side. What United, with their long-standing issues in central midfield, would give for these options.</p><p>Bayern are playing with the confidence and swagger that, in short, United used to consider the norm. Guardiola's team have won 16 of their previous 19 games and lost only twice in the past year. Once was in the Champions League against Manchester City when Bayern were already qualified from the group stages. The other occasion was the German equivalent of the Community Shield. Moyes summed it up succinctly. \"I came into the Champions League as a really inexperienced manager. We have done well but now we have the ultimate test.\"</p><p>His team, he said optimistically, would go into the game knowing that \"on our day we are as good as anyone\". What he did not explain was why there had been so few of those days. Juan Mata is ineligible, meaning Moyes will also have to draw up a new-look attack, already missing Robin van Persie, and it is never really ideal when the team are relying on a 40-year-old in midfield. Giggs was sublime against Olympiakos in the last round but, at his age, there has to be the danger of being over-run against such players as Bastian Schweinsteiger, Kroos and Mario Götze.</p><p>Giggs did his best to counter any suggestion that he was not particularly enamoured by the manager's work. Nobody, of course, would ever have expected him to say the opposite but the most relevant part was probably when the club's longest-serving player was asked whether these were his final weeks as a footballer. Giggs's declaration that he would wait until the end of the season before deciding was a break from the norm. Last year his contract extension was announced on 8 March. In 2012 it was 1 March and the previous year 18 February. Supposition, perhaps, but it was difficult not to come away with the sense that the end is close.</p><p>First things first, of course, and what Moyes would give for a performance of vintage Giggs one more time. Instead it is the opposition's wide players who boast the most obvious credentials to shape this fixture. Jones, for all his qualities, is not the nimblest full-back against fast, tricky opponents and they do not come much faster or trickier than Ribéry.</p><p>Buttner faces similar problems on the left and Moyes was surely being diplomatic when he said he would not warn him about Robben's diving. For United everything has to be planned meticulously. It is going to require their most tactically astute and defensively fine-tuned performance of the season. Twice, in fact.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/433440966|2014-05-04T13:20:47Z|a5fa0f8ebd29b31cff8f937fc8df1e54699a33dc -->",

Although it is understood that the Welshman has taken a lesser role during training, he was seen in discussion with Moyes during Monday morning's session.</p><p>Giggs, seated next to the 50-year-old for the press conference before Bayern's visit, was asked how he got on with Moyes and being underused as player this campaign.</p><p>He said: \"There is no problem with the manager; I don't know where that came from. The relationship is good. Of course as a player you want to play all the time. I know over the last five or six years you are not going to play every game. I normally play every two or three weeks to get the best out of me. The last game was probably my first for seven weeks but you are not sulking, you just have to be ready to play your best for the team.\"</p><p>Giggs' 12-month deal ends this summer, yet he would not be drawn on whether this could be his last European campaign, stating that playing on will be considered. \"I don't know. I'll tell you after tomorrow [Tuesday],\" he said. \"I am just trying to enjoy this season and then at the end I will take stock and see what I want to do. I am enjoying my football as much as ever, I feel fit and then at the end of the season, I will see what I want to do.\"</p><p>Giggs, a member of the United team that triumphed over Bayern in the 1999 final, admitted the German club's current side are a formidable foe but refused to bill them as favourites.</p><p>\"Bayern are a fantastic team, they are the holders and Pep Guardiola has taken over and added a few new players and they are a very strong team, favourites in most people's eyes. But we are Manchester United, and at Old Trafford we have had so many great nights. We don't see ourselves as underdogs, we see ourselves as Manchester United playing at home.\"</p><p>Sir Alex Ferguson, Moyes' predecessor, has been blamed in some quarters for United's disappointing campaign, with questions raised about the strength of the squad he left. Moyes himself claimed Ferguson might have struggled this term because of the \"ageing\" nature of some players but Guardiola denied the 71-year-old could be viewed as at all culpable.</p><p>The Spaniard, who in his first season at Bayern won the Bundesliga with seven games to spare, did not speak directly of Moyes' comments. But he did say: \"I don't know how Sir Alex Ferguson can have a bad influence on this club. It's completely opposite. This club was the best club in England thanks to him. He reorganised the club and put the club on another level in this country.\"</p><p>Moyes wants to sign Toni Kroos, the Bayern midfielder. But Guardiola said: \"Toni has one year more of a contract and Toni will remain. I hope he can extend his contract and stay with us because he is a very good guy, he loves his game. It is not just a job for him and I would like him to stay but I spoke with the player, with the club, I gave my opinion. After that I am not manager, I am just the trainer.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/433413497|2014-05-04T13:20:47Z|36a79ec45824c546665680cdeff55eb7f0509ec0 -->",
